        "document": "Chelsea have made an offer for FC Tokyo's 22-year-old forward Yoshinori Muto, according to club president\u00a0Naoki Ogane. The Japan international, who has played for the J-League side since 2013, will join Chelsea's Dutch partner club Vitesse Arnhem on loan next season if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Ogane claims that Chelsea's interest in Muto is not connected to the \u00a3200million sponsorship deal they signed with Japanese company Yokohama Rubber in February. FC Tokyo forward\u00a0Yoshinori Muto (centre) brings the ball forward against\u00a0Albirex Niigata in March . FC Tokyo president\u00a0Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto . Muto tussles with\u00a0Yuji Nakazawa of Yokohama F.Marinos during a J-League clash last month . Age: 22 . Club: FC Tokyo . Appearances: 37 . Goals: 16 . International caps (Japan): 11 . International goals:\u00a01 . Did you know? Muto graduated from\u00a0Keio University in Tokyo with an economics degree two weeks ago . Speaking to Sports Nippon, Ogane said:\u00a0'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto. 'It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.' Muto, who\u00a0only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, would be the first Japanese player to represent Chelsea if he moves to west London. He has earned 11 caps for his country after signing his first professional contract in 2014, scoring once for the Samurai Blue. A \u00a34million deal for the youngster has been mooted, but Muto admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid. He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.' Muto scored 13 times in his debut season with FC Tokyo and was named in the J-League's best XI. Muto admits it is an 'honour' to receive an offer from Chelsea although he has not yet decided to join the club . Muto, pictured in action against\u00a0Ventforet Kofu has scored three goals in four games so far this season . The 22-year-old has a shot at goal during Japan's Asian Cup match against Palestine in January this year . He has continued his fine form during the current campaign, helping his club to third place in the division with three goals in four games. Yokohama Rubber - one of the world's largest tyre manufacturers - will become Chelsea's official shirt sponsors from the start of the 2015-16 season. The initial five-year deal is the biggest in the club's history, with the Blues now considering a two-week pre-season tour of Japan this summer.",

        "document": "Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found (file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. This frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys. 'Epidemic': By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight (file photo) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences.' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak.",

        "document": "This is the embarrassing moment a Buckingham Palace guard slipped and fell on a manhole cover in front of hundreds of shocked tourists as he took up position in his sentry box. The Queen's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera. He lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle. The Queen's Guard (pictured) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week. Unfortunately for him, the entire incident was caught on a tourist's camera . The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. Tourist David Meadwell shot this footage of the Changing of the Guard last week when the incident unfolded . The moment it all started to go wrong: The guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip . The unidentified young guard's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away . The guard, wearing full regalia, falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up . 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying. There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down. 'I think he just slipped on a manhole cover, he looked so embarrassed.' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter. The Guard comprises two detachments, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard. Contrary to popular belief they are not purely ceremonial and are fully operational soldiers. The Ministry of Defence said they would not comment on 'a young man falling over while doing his job'. The embarrassed guard hastily scrambled to his feet following the unfortunate tumble at the palace . The incident took place in front of hundreds of tourists who were watching the Changing of the Guard .",

Now A&E networks are remaking the miniseries, to air in 2016. A&E, Lifetime and History (formerly the History Channel) announced Thursday that the three networks would simulcast a remake of the saga of Kunta Kinte, an African who was captured, shipped to America and sold into slavery to work on a Virginia plantation. LeVar Burton, who portrayed Kinte in the original, will co-executive produce the new miniseries. A press release describes the new version as \"original\" and \"contemporary\" and will draw more from Alex Haley's classic novel, \"Roots: The Saga of an American Family.\" Producers will consult scholars in African and African-American history for added authenticity. \"We are proud to bring this saga to fans of the original, as well as to a new generation that will experience this powerful and poignant tale for the first time,\" said Dirk Hoogstra, History's executive vice president and general manager. \"Audiences will once again feel the impact of Kunta Kinte's indomitable spirit.\" Executive producer Mark Wolper, son of the original's producer David L. Wolper, added, \"Kunta Kinte began telling his story over 200 years ago and that story went through his family lineage, to Alex Haley, to my father, and now the mantle rests with me. Like Kunta Kinte fought to tell his story over and over again, so must we.\" The remade \"Roots\" will encounter a new generation of viewers who have witnessed Barack Obama make history as the nation's first African-American president and \"12 Years a Slave\" win the Oscar for Best Picture, but also widespread racial unrest over police treatment of black suspects in many U.S. cities. \"My career began with 'Roots' and I am proud to be a part of this new adaptation,\" said Burton. \"There is a huge audience of contemporary young Americans who do not know the story of 'Roots' or its importance.\"",

        "document": "Police are investigating claims by a former royal footman that palace aides tried to force him into an orgy, it was revealed yesterday. Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House. The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day. He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s. Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s . But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified, he claims. Mr Lawler, now 64, said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother\u2019s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27. He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift. Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them \u2013 one a senior member of staff, he said. He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself. \u2018That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me,\u2019 he told the Sunday People. \u2018I was staggered. The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me, holding me in the chair. Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence . \u2018They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room.\u2019 Afterwards, Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet. A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House \u2013 so he packed his bags immediately. Mr Lawler, a former Port of Liverpool police officer, said he was \u2018haunted\u2019 by the incident for years. After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace, but was twice rebuffed. Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard. A retired royal aide, who is now in his 80s, was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time. Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work \u2018exhaustively and co-operatively\u2019 with any police probe. A police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment \u2018as investigations continue\u2019.",

During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite, played by Vivien Leigh, and co-starred Clark gable as Rhett Butler .

'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

        "document": "Rome (CNN)Italy is coping with a rising wave of desperate migrants from Africa and Middle East hoping to make it to Europe. From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea . CNN's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.",

        "document": "Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger does not know the exact reason Alexis Sanchez chose the Emirates Stadium over Anfield - but he is glad the Chile forward will be lining up for his side rather than against them for Liverpool on Saturday. Sanchez had his selection of clubs once Barcelona had decided to let him leave, and following the World Cup, the 26-year-old was convinced to continue his career under Wenger's expert guidance, going on to make an instant impression in English football. The French coach, however, admits the possibility Liverpool could use their interest in Sanchez as leverage during negotiations over Luis Suarez's move to the Nou Camp last summer was always on the cards. Alexis Sanchez was courted by a number of elite clubs last summer but eventually chose Arsenal . Sanchez has made an instant impact in English football and has scored 19 goals so far this season . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (right) is delighted that Sanchez decided to join the north London club . 'At the end of the day, only Sanchez can explain to you why he has chosen us. I don't know why he did that, but we are happy that he made that decision,' said Wenger of the \u00a332million Chile forward, who has netted 19 goals so far. 'I was (aware of Liverpool's interest), but you never know if it is really true, but I thought it could be because of the interest in Suarez (from Barcelona). 'In the negotiations, yes, it is a strength - and it makes sense, an exchange and some money for Liverpool.' Wenger believes the way Sanchez has adapted so quickly to a change in environment proves he is one of the best around. 'If you look at the qualities, efficiency, work-rate, fighting spirit - (he is at the) top,' the Arsenal boss added. 'When it (the game) becomes flat, he can revitalise the strengths and dynamics of the team and the supporters.' Ahead of the key Barclays Premier League clash, Wenger was keen to play down any talk of a potential summer transfer move for Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling, who has so far rejected a new contract offer. Despite the Reds having lost to Manchester United before the international break to dent hopes of another top-four finish, Wenger has been impressed by the way Brendan Rodgers has developed his team following the sale of Suarez and injury to striker Daniel Sturridge. 'He has done very well. I think he found a solution at the right time,' the Arsenal manager said. 'They did well last season too, they scored over 100 goals in the Premier League, which is absolutely fantastic.' Wenger has moved to play down speculation linking him with Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling .",

The four-time Olympic champion and 2012 Tour de France winner, who is 35 on April 28, will attempt to add to his accomplishments by riding the furthest distance in 60 minutes at the Lee Valley VeloPark. 'The Hour Record is a holy grail for cyclists,' Wiggins said. Four-time Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins will bid to break cycling's hour record in June . Wiggins finished his Team Sky career in the Paris-Roubaix 253.5km one-day race on Sunday . Australian rider Rohan Dennis poses after breaking the world hour record on February 8 in Grenchen . 'It's been fought over tooth and nail by some of the greatest names in our sport for over a hundred years and it's time for me to have a crack at it. 'I like the idea of challenging myself and want to motivate people to do the same - so why not get your bike out of the shed and see how far you can go in an hour?' Wiggins, whose track pedigree includes three Olympic gold medals, is expected to set a mark which will last for some time. Wiggins will hope for a capacity 6,000 crowd to spur on his attempt, with tickets going on sale from April 19, while the event will be broadcast live on Sky Sports. In June, Wiggins will hope to race in front of a sell-out crowd at London's Olympic Velodrome . Wiggins (left) alongside his Team Sky colleague Luke Rowe after the pair raced the Paris-Roubaix .

The Briton finished his Team Sky career at Paris-Roubaix last Sunday and will ride in next month's inaugural Tour de Yorkshire for his eponymous team before preparing for the Hour as part of his return to the track. The world time-trial champion is targeting a British record eighth Olympic medal - he has four gold, one silver and two bronze - at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the four-man, four-kilometre team pursuit. The current Hour record is 52.491km, set by Australian Rohan Dennis in February after the UCI, cycling's world governing body, reformed regulations, reigniting interest in the event. German Jens Voigt was the first to make an attempt last September, recording 51.115km, a mark which stood for six weeks before Austria's Matthias Brandle rode 51.852km, while Jack Bobridge was the first to fall short in his attempt. Dennis' mark will come under threat from Briton Alex Dowsett, who will make his attempt on May 2 in Manchester having had to postpone it previously after suffering a broken collarbone.

The US  were beaten 3-2 as Williams and Alison Riske were thrashed 6-0 6-3 in the doubles rubber by Errani and Flavia Pennetta, meaning they were relegated to World Group II. American tennis star Serena Williams fought back to beat Italian Sara Errani in the Fed Cup play-off on Sunday . Tough weather conditions made it difficult for both players who had to keep on re-tossing their serves . Errani gave Williams a real scare but in the end the world No 1's power proved to be too much . 'Today has been a big eye opener,' Williams said afterwards. 'I'm totally not as ready for the claycourt season as I thought I was. Now I'm in the mindset of, \"You know what, I'm not on hard court.\" I'm playing like I'm on hard court and I'm not.

'We have to work harder,' US captain Mary Joe Fernandez said. 'We came close today and need to just keep plugging away.

Siler's family and friends have called the billboard 'disrespectful' and are asking for it be taken down. 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.' Aaron Siler, right, was fatally shot after he 'armed himself with a weapon' after being confronted by officer Pablo Torres, left, on March 14 . A car is damaged after a police chase: Siler, who was wanted on an active felony probation and parole warrant, was shot and killed by Torres following a vehicle and foot pursuit . Siler, who was wanted on an active felony probation and parole warrant, was shot and killed by Torres following a vehicle and foot pursuit. That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified. The investigation into Siler's death continues.",

        "document": "(CNN)Eight Iranian border guards have been killed in clashes with militants near the border with Pakistan, Iranian state media reported. Three of the militants were killed by Iranian forces in the fighting Monday in the southeastern town of Negur, the state-run news agency IRNA reported. The news agency cited Ali Asghar Mirshekari, the deputy governor of Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province, who said the militants crossed into the country from Pakistan. Iranian officials have reportedly asked Pakistani authorities to catch the surviving assailants. A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization. According to Pakistani media, Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan, the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran. The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory. One of the deadliest was in October 2013, when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan. Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks, the militants have fled back into Balochistan. \"Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists,\" IRNA said, referring to Pakistan. The Pakistani government condemned Monday's attack, calling it an \"act of terrorism.\" \"The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident, which took place on Iran's territory, and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have,\" the government said in a statement Wednesday. If the militants entered Pakistan after the attack, \"they will be apprehended and brought to justice,\" it said.",

        "document": "(CNN)The classic video game \"Space Invaders\" was developed in Japan back in the late 1970's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan's corridors of power. Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. \"When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,\" Nakatani said. He continued: \"They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth.\" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as \"among the most respected men in sports-entertainment\" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's \"basketball diplomacy\" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

Then man broke the toilet in Hefei Xinqiao International Airport in the city of Hefei . The passenger reportedly confessed to his friends that he was squatting on the toilet, but later changed his story to the police, possibly to avoid paying compensation, and said he was sitting when the poorly built toilet gave way.

        "document": "Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man . A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown. Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail.",

        "document": "Kaitlyn Granado, 24, was arrested on Monday amid claims she had sex with pupil, 15, in her car on consecutive nights in January . A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts. Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail. Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year. According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas. The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month. She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to the\u00a0Dallas Morning News. She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials. At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her. A spokesman for the police department said: 'There was some discussion, some rumoring, there may have been a second person involved. 'That information came from within the school, and it turned out to be true.' Granado, who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas (pictured), was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy, also 15, and lettin him touch her breasts . Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday, and released after posting a $50,000 bail. It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her. A spokesman for Irving school district said: 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details, we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action. 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property.'",

        "document": "A video of a menacing crocodile swimming through a public marina with a dead pet dog locked in between its jaws has been viewed more than half a million times online. The clip shows a large croc calmly moving through the marina in the tourist hotspot of Puerto Vallarta, in Mexico, with a black dog wearing a red collar lifeless in its mouth. New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when the attack happened and described how 'the crocodile kept the dog in its mouth for ages, not moving at all'. Mr Weston told Daily Mail Australia the dog belonged to the local bike shop's owner. Scroll down for video . The large croc proudly held on to its catch for hours as it lurked around the Puerto Vallarta marina, in Mexico . 'There's a sanctuary for these crocodiles up the river (200m away) which runs out to the sea and the marina,' Mr Weston explained. 'The dog went to the water's edge to see the crocodile (being curious I guess) but things didn't go according to plan obviously. 'It was certainly a shock to the system. Guess that's nature though,' he said. In the video the beast glides through the water, with rocks on one side and a footpath on the other, as crowds gasp in amazement. New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when he saw the alarming sight . Tourist Tim Weston took a photo of the crocodile with the dog between its jaws . A video of the crocodile swimming through the marina with the bike shop owner's dog has been viewed more than 500,000 times . Mr Weston said: 'A couple of hours later we walked back past and there was still a crowd... But we didn't want to look at it again as we had just eaten. Yesterday morning there was no sign of either.' Social media users have reacted in horror to the video that was posted on the\u00a0Bogged\u00a0Facebook page. One woman  called the video 'horrible' and another said 'I hate crocodiles now'. But crocodiles are a common site in Puerto Vallarta as the Mexican beach resort is built amongst the mangroves that the creatures have called home for centuries. As well as living in the nearby sanctuary, crocs are regularly spotted on the resort's golf course. In Mexico the 'American Crocodiles' can reach lengths of 6 meters and as a result of urbanisation are living closer to humans than ever before. One social media user called the video 'horrible' and another said 'I hate crocodiles now'",

        "document": "Steve Bruce is adamant he can keep Hull City in the Barclays Premier League after a 2-0 defeat by Southampton left them battling to stay up. At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive, but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough.' Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation . They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it. If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line. 'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year. I've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you've created an expectation and unfortunately we haven't been able to live up to that expectation. Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone . 'We've got our reasons for it, we've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope. We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all. Bruce added: 'They are big players for us and unfortunately, at this moment, we haven't been able to cope. We've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough.' James Ward-Prowse slots home a penalty for Southampton against Hull as they moved up to fifth . Ronald Koeman's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham, who lost to Aston Villa, and Liverpool, who play Newcastle on Monday. But the Dutchman left with his own problems, after he had to intervene when Sadio Mane tried to take the penalty when Ward-Prowse was first-choice. Koeman will speak to his squad to remind them that team rules cannot be broken by anyone. Koeman said: 'I already had a word with Mane but we will talk to the team about that because maybe I have to mention it a bit more clearly.'",

        "document": "A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher\u2019s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick\u2019s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel\u2019s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.",

While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008. No love: 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby's auction Wednesday . The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the\u00a0Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home. Yankee Stadium: The letters at the stadium, which was built in 1923, were installed in 1976 and taken down in 2008 . In addition to the letters, Sotheby's was auctioning off a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s. Despite the Mets memorabilia being estimated at only $20,000 to $30,000, it raked in a winning bid of $112,500 at auction.",

Then 24 hours later pictures emerged of Sterling and Ibe with shisha pipes. Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season .

Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things \u2014 and I\u2019m not talking about this instance \u2014 (but) how it gets framed is totally different.\u2019 Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard, available after a three-match suspension, an immediate recall against Villa, making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign. They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January, but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress. Reds have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for their FA Cup semi after serving a three-match suspension . \u2018When you get so close, whether it was in the title race or the cup, it hurts,\u2019 said Rodgers. \u2018Trace back the winners in sport. If you look at everything they have won, also look at what they have lost. You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on. \u2018Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals.

        "document": "Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: \u2018The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.\u2019",

        "document": "(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. \"The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,\" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.",

Then, on April 1, Schoenig was shocked to learn that police had found her car after receiving a tip from a man who recognized the vehicle as Schoenig's and would be returning it to her - but with a few minor changes. Scroll down for video . Bling: Becky Schoenig was shocked when her stolen car was located and returned to her with new red rims and detailing (above) Theft: The\u00a0brand new 2015 Ford Fusion (above) had been stolen from her driveway Monday .

As the car pulled up, Schoenig noticed that the rims had been spray painted red, there was red detailing on the sides of the car, and her steering wheel now had some orange accents. Rather than get upset however, she simply took to Facebook\u00a0and posted a photo of her and her new ride, writing; 'I want to thank the car thieves for pimping out my vehicle for me.... This b***h is pimpin now!!!' She also attached a photo of the car which, given the date, many thought was a joke. It was not all 'lollipops and rainbows' though Schoenig told KSDK, and she is now getting the vehicle professionally cleaned to deal with the strong smell of cigarettes and marijuana. She is also creating a smoothie at the restaurant she owns, The Hot Pot, to honor Mick Sexton, the man who located her car and notified police. The Sexton on Wheels will feature banana, pineapple, peach and coconut cream. 'She's a very special person,' said Marlene Trice, a friend of Schoenig. 'She is vibrant and happy and really loves making people laugh.'",

        "document": "First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with\u00a0a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.",

        "document": "(CNN)The parents of the youngest victim of the Boston Marathon bombings are making an emotional, passionate plea to take the death penalty off the table for the man convicted in the case. Last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty on all 30 charges he faced related to the bombings at the 2013 race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward. A look at all of the charges . The sentencing phase begins Tuesday, a day after this year's edition of the landmark race. It is expected to last four weeks. The 13th Juror: Now it gets real . In a front-page opinion piece in The Boston Globe, Bill and Denise Richard wrote about the toll taken on their family after the death of their 8-year-old son, Martin. Their daughter, Jane, also was severely injured. \"Our family has grieved, buried our young son, battled injuries, and endured numerous surgeries -- all while trying to rebuild lives that will never be the same,\" they said in the Globe column titled \"To end the anguish, drop the death penalty.\" \"We sat in the courtroom, day after day, bearing witness to overwhelming evidence that included graphic video and photographs, replicated bombs, and even the clothes our son wore his last day alive.\" They said they understood the \"heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed.\" \"We were there. We lived it. The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son, maimed our 7-year-old daughter, and stole part of our soul.\" But now the Richards are urging the Justice Department to bring the case to a close. \"We are in favor of and would support the Department of Justice in taking the death penalty off the table in exchange for the defendant spending the rest of his life in prison without any possibility of release and waiving all of his rights to appeal,\" they wrote. They go on to say: \"We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives. We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring.\" Martin Richard and two others were killed and more 200 people wounded when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line on April 15, 2013. Tsarnaev was convicted last week, while his brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a shootout with police two years ago. The Richards never mention Tsarnaev by name. They stress that they were only speaking for themselves when they argue against the death penalty. \"We believe that now is the time to turn the page, end the anguish, and look toward a better future -- for us, for Boston, and for the country,\" they wrote.",

        "document": "These extraordinary images show how an enormous jumbo jet has been converted into a luxury home for a mystery billionaire - complete with bedrooms, multiple lounges and an onboard restaurant. The custom-built Boeing 747 is believed to have cost its ultra-wealthy owner \u00a3400million after it was customised to fit his specifications exactly over a three-year period. The jumbo jet would normally carry as many as 600 passengers - but this version was built for just a single tycoon, although he will be able to fit dozens of guests. It contains a large dining room where travellers can enjoy meals cooked in an adjoining kitchen, with a lounge and 'state room' at the back of the plane. More sleeping space is provided in the 'aeroloft' on the top deck of the vessel, with eight full beds for passengers who prefer to get some shut-eye on flights. Luxury: This is the lounge on board a custom-built Boeing 747-8, as depicted in an artist's impression by Greenpoint Technologies . Shuteye: The master bedroom of the \u00a3400million plane has a huge bed as well as an armchair and sofa for when the owner needs to relax . Business: The conference room of the plane could be perfect for meetings in the sky with its long table in the centre . Chill-out: The lounge decor looks like a luxury hotel, belying its true location inside a plane similar to those used by commercial airlines . Executive: This room, which can be used as an office or a guest bedroom, gives a hint to its true location thanks to the porthole-style windows . Kicking back: The main suite could easily be mistaken for a room in a top hotel thanks to its over-the-top decorations . Restaurant: The central portion of the plane hosts a dining room which is attached to a kitchen, allowing the owner to make use of the services of a private chef . Shiny: The jumbo jet is one of the most luxurious private planes ever built, with the price tag believed to have reached a total of \u00a3400million . Sofa: Parts of the plane are set aside for guests to relax while watching television, as the vessel can carry several dozen passengers . Plush: Another artist's impression of the main state room, which also contains a desk so the owner can switch between work and relaxation . Welcoming: Images of the lounge show a space very different to the normal aeroplane cabin, with the traditional rows of seats completely discarded in favour of a hotel-like ambience . Exclusive: Few people can ever imagine flying in this sort of luxury - far more glitzy than first class on commercial flights . Plan: The layout of the Boeing 747 is shown in this plan published by Greenpoint Technologies . Gigantic: The luxury interior has been built inside a Boeing 747-8 similar to this one, which can hold up to 600 passengers .",

        "document": "(CNN)SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: \"Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.\" He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to \"reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.\" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday's launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.",

The 69-year-old collaborated with NBC's\u00a0Today show to launch a contest for one Elvis-obsessed couple to win the 'ultimate wedding'. The winning duo - announced next Monday - will tie the knot at Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel inside the Westgate Hotel on Thursday, April 23. Novel idea: Priscilla Presley will serve as a witness at the first wedding to be held at an all new chapel of love in Las Vegas . Westgate, formerly the Las Vegas Hilton, is where Elvis performed more than 830 sold-out shows. Along with the singer's former wife in the audience, the winning couple will  win a free wedding reception and hotel suite for two nights. To top it off, airfares and concert tickets to the Elvis Experience theater show will also be thrown in. While Priscilla agreed to make an appearance, the woman who wed Elvis in 1967 made one thing clear before unveiling the latest wedding chapel to bear his name: No impersonators. 'This is all first-class,' she told the Associated Press recently. 'This is not a joke. The wedding chapel is not a joke.' The actress and business magnate has been involved in the look and feel of the chapel that officials say is part of the first permanent Graceland exhibit of the singer's artifacts outside his iconic Memphis, Tennessee, home. Couples wanting to be the first  to  wed at the Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel must submit a video or photos along with an explanation detailing why they deserve the prize.

Henderson and Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet both played their 47th game of season in the 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday night, equalling the record for appearances by any player in the top five European leagues so far this campaign. But the England midfielder believes that after finding winning form again following poor results against Manchester United and Arsenal, Liverpool can pile the pressure on to City who sit four points above them in the race for the Champions League. Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson thinks his side could catch Manchester City in the  Premier League . Henderson played his 47th game of season in the 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday night . Manchester City have been faltering and lost 4-2 at Manchester United, Liverpool are four points behind . 'We knew it was an important game for us,' Henderson said 'Obviously the last couple of weeks in the Premier League have been disappointing both with performances and results. We knew today we needed to put that right and I think we did that with a great result for us. 'We've got ground to make up but we'll just keep going, keep winning in games and putting in performances. Come the end of the season, you never know.' Raheem Sterling pulled off some fine skill to open the scoring in the ninth minute at Anfield before Joe Allen capitalised on a defensive mistake to score his first Anfield goal with 20 minutes to go. Raheem Sterling pulled off some fine skill to open the scoring in the ninth minute at Anfield on Monday night . Joe Allen capitalised on a defensive mistake to score his first Anfield goal to make it 2-0 with 20 minutes to go . 'It was great to get that goal to give us that two-goal cushion,' Allen said. 'It wasn't my best game but I got the goal and helped the team. It was important after the defeats.' Newcastle had what looked a strong shout for a penalty when Dejan Lovren appeared to foul Ayoze Perez in the area, and Allen admitted he thought it was a spot-kick. 'I did get a good view of it as I'd missed the ball in the build-up,' he said. 'It look a good shout for a penalty, but I didn't get one the other night. These things happen.'

        "document": "Roma ended their four-month winless streak at home with a victory over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday in a key match for Champions League places. Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half. 'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack . Pjanic (second left) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe, and Daniele de Rossi after scoring . Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio, who play later on Saturday. They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30. Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth. Security was tight for Napoli's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico. Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game . Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis (right) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points . Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order. But there were no reports of problems. Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post. A few minutes later, Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi, who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in. Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home . Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma, who have fallen off the pace recently . Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there wasn't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli, who officiated last year's World Cup final. In the second half, De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions. The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th. Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net. Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne came on late for his first action since tearing his knee in November.",

        "document": "Cats and dogs have the advantage over marine pets in that they can interact with humans through the sense of touch. But that doesn\u2019t prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid  a stroke. Capturing his remarkable relationship on camera, Roland Giroux gently cups the fish with his hand from within side the tank and then treats it to a massage. The fish begins relaxing in the man's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger . The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man\u2019s fingers. The man then begins massaging the pet by running his finger along it and the fish stays completely still as if enjoying the sensation. Repeating the process, the fish swims off once more before immediately returning to the man\u2019s hand to be stroked again. Later in the video the fish interacts further with the man by swimming up his arm and circling his fingers. The man places his hand into the tank and gently cups the\u00a0blood parrot cichlid with his fingers . Before burying its face into his hand and remaining very still once more. The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish, clearly saddened by this, following it up to the surface of the water. According to Mr Giroux, who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel, the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish. The fish swims away from the man's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged . But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet. He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable. After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he didn\u2019t play with it on a daily basis. The fish begins swimming around the man's fingers and towards the surface as he removes his hand . The man massages and plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day. The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid of the midas and the redhead cichlid and was first bred in Taiwan around 1986.",

When Ben Stokes first turned up at the Kensington Oval this week someone would have said: \u2018Mind that locker, Stokesey.\u2019 It was here, of course, that Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the England team. Ben Stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the England cricket team . Stokes (left) clashed with Marlon Samuels during the second Test between West Indies and England . But Stokes (right) responded positively to the row after talking to England coach Peter Moores . Only a slight niggle in his back might stop Stokes playing here in Barbados and I am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs. I like Stokes and I like his character at a time when the game can be perceived as producing robots and players who cannot capture the imagination. He has something about him, as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson\u2019s face during the Ashes series. He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return. But I do believe he will need careful man-managing. Peter Moores, England\u2019s coach, dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right. The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on. England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on. It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad. What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed. He can be feisty and fiery as long as it\u2019s natural but his aggression has to be controlled. You want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets. Stokes (second left) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the England team . Stokes (left) congratulates England captain Alastair Cook after the side won the second Test . England want to have Stokes in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential . Let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally. There is an argument here to play the second spinner in Adil Rashid and if England went down that route in Bridgetown the place of Stokes or Chris Jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible. This summer there will rarely be the need for two spinners so England want these two exciting cricketers to grow into the international game. They can only get better and that\u2019s an exciting prospect.",

        "document": "A woman who suffered seven miscarriages has spoken of her distress after a family friend stole the money set aside for her babies' grave stone. The bereaved mother, named Dawn, was appearing on The Jeremy Kyle show and accused long-term chum, convicted burglar Jamie, of making off with the cash. When one of Mr Kyle's famous lie detector tests revealed that Jamie, who lives with Dawn and her partner who is also called Jamie, had done the deed, she burst into tears and stormed off. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Dawn, who has had seven miscarriages, was furious to discover her friend had stolen from her . The drama began when Dawn, who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show, discovered that \u00a3207 set aside for a \u00a3500 grave stone had disappeared. Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol, she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial. 'Only him and Carol knew where it was,' she said during an angry confrontation on the ITV show. 'Me and Jamie had been saving up and only Carol knew where it was.' Unable to prove it, she asked Mr Kyle to conduct a lie detector test and when the results came back, it showed that Jamie had indeed taken the cash. Caught out: Jamie, who has been to prison for burglary, was found to be lying after taking a test . Outraged: Dawn, who was going to spend the money on a gravestone, was left furious by the revelation . Mr Kyle also revealed that Jamie had sent a Facebook message to Dawn during the journey to London in which he declared his undying love and confessed to taking the money but blamed it on girlfriend Carol. Speaking after the show, a sobbing Dawn said: \u00a0'I've had seven miscarriages and only one of them I've had to bury. 'That was Daniel James and the \u00a3207 was put aside because the head stone was going to cost \u00a3500 altogether. 'We had to stand there and say goodbye to Daniel James and the last thing I wanted to do for Daniel James was put a head stone on him so he knew how much his mummy and daddy loved him. I feel betrayed, horrible. You try and do a good gesture to people and then you get it thrown in your face.' Tears: She then burst into tears and rushed off the stage - pursued by the Jeremy Kyle cameras . Sobbing: She was comforted by her partner, also called Jamie, after the show .",

        "document": "(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.",

Rodgers' future at Anfield has been questioned after a third straight season without a trophy, but the former Liverpool defender backed the Reds manager. Speaking after collecting a Beacon Award for his community work on Merseyside on Tuesday, Carragher said: 'I don't think your whole future should be determined by one game. Jamie Carragher shared this image on Instagram after collecting a Beacon Award on Tuesday . 'It was difficult with the players that came in and I still don't think many of them have bedded in yet.' Liverpool are seven points behind fourth placed Manchester City with a game in hand and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season. Carragher added: 'Brendan, the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further, winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four. 'That's his job. He has to identify where in the team they need to improve; the squad is there and they did a lot of that last summer. Brendan Rodgers is under pressure at Liverpool after a third straight season without a trophy . Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup by Aston Villa in a disappointing semi-final performance . 'The signings have to be right, and if they are it will make a massive difference. If they're not they'll be back to where they are this season.' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside. The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. Carragher, pictured at the 26th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, backed Rodgers to stay at Anfield . The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. 'I'm from an under-privileged area \u2013 Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would.

A four-year-old boy was frisked by airport security and then forced to hand over his plastic nerf gun after it was deemed a security risk. James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video . After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun . The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport . The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.' East Midlands Airport said that 'no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item'",

        "document": "Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes. Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs . Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise)\u00a0Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and\u00a0Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call . Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility. 'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.' The rise of Harry Kane (centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters . A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason. 'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write. 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all: opportunity.'",

Scroll down for video . Last week she was barely showing \u2013 but Demelza Poldark is now the proud mother to the show\u2019s latest addition . He may have married his red-headed kitchen maid out of duty, but as he tells her that she makes him a better man, audiences can have little doubt about his feelings. What is rather less convincing, however, is the timeline of the pregnancy. With the climax of the previous episode being the announcement of the pregnancy, it is quite a jump to the start of tomorrow\u2019s instalment where Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, talks about being eight months pregnant. Just minutes after \u2013 once again without any nod to the passing of time \u2013 she is giving birth, with the last month of her pregnancy passing in less than the blink of an eye.

The Foxes host Swansea on Saturday just three points from safety in the Barclays Premier League after back-to-back wins.

Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday to improve his side's slim chance of Premier League survival . Vardy celebrates in front of the travelling away fans after hitting the winner against West Brom . But after their mini-revival, Pearson wants his side to remain focused on their own jobs. 'I'm very wary of people flipping the emphasis,' he said. 'Our future is in our own hands and if we go into the last game with that we have given ourselves a realistic chance. 'We need to make sure our own run-in is what we want it to be. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has urged his players to focus on their own job and not worry about their relegation rivals during run-in . 'It's helpful that other teams are being dragged into it. People are continually adjusting the form table and their predictions. 'We can't get involved in anything apart from being involved in our own games that may change people's perceptions. 'It's great when results go your way but they only help if you've done your own job. 'It's important for us to be in touch. One of the potential problems we have to deal with is people are now overly optimistic.'",

        "document": "(CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for \"Barbara,\" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the \"warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited \"three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,\" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. \"For her to go to Mexico,\" Mate said, \"It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from.\" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to \"navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,\" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower. \"Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look,\" Mate said.

The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places, exposing what used to be the ocean floor. Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby,\u00a0when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Scroll down for video . Surprise! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu, on Hokkaido Island, Japan . 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide', local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday. The mass, which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level, \u00a0measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide, a town official said. The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the land movement overnight . 'The local residents said they didn't hear any sounds and there were no tremors (when the land appeared),' said Katsuhiro Tanaka, the president of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperative Association, who viewed the expanded coastline the day it was discovered. The mass, which has risen some 50ft above sea level, measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide . No clue: Local residents on Hokkaido island say they felt no tremors overnight, or heard any sounds to indicate movement, and that the landmass just appeared . New view: Local residents from Rausu, Hokkaido, take a look at the newly emerged coastline . Authorities have not been able to determine exactly when the landslide hit the snow-covered coastline, but they do not expect it to expand further, said an official at the central government's Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau. 'Our understanding is that this is different from earthquakes,' he told AFP. It is not believed to be related to the 7.8magnitude earthquake that struck the Kathmandu Valley on Saturday, which so far has claimed more than 4,000 lives. Under the sea: Marine organisms such as seaweed and sea urchins are still attached to the land mass .",

The former Manchester City striker's deal with the Serie A champions does not expire until the end of next season but he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer. Boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club\u00a0president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with the Italians first. Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer . Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory . 'We must be careful', Angelici told TYC Sports. 'We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016. 'We are close to sealing his return and it will be done shortly.' The Argentina international joined Boca's youth academy in 1996 and went on to score 26 league goals in 76 appearances for the club before joining Corinthians in 2005. Although Juventus are reluctant to lose the league's top scorer - Tevez has netted 17 times this season - they have accepted the player wants to leave and have already started identifying potential replacements.

Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil (right) took to Instagram to show off his new Apple Watch on Thursday . Ozil compared his watch to TV character Michael Knight in the hit action show Knight Rider . Ozil took to Instagram to share his joy at his latest gift, comparing his gadget to former TV character Michael Knight from the hit action show Knight Rider. Accompanied with the caption: 'Excited about my new cool gadget! It's just like Michael Knight's watch, but a real one #knightrider #phone,' Ozil appears in awe of the device - which will be released on general sale on Friday. The midfielder, who has scored four goals in 25 matches for the Gunners in all competitions this season, is expected to start for Arsene Wenger's side at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Arsenal trail the Blues by 10 points with six league games remaining - but have been boosted by the return of Jack Wilshere. Wilshere was on the bench in their FA Cup semi-final win over Reading at Wembley on April 18 after five months out through injury.

And, although Clattenburg has been accused of favouring Louis van Gaal's side in the past, it's worth noting that the 40-year-old has only sent off two players season in the Premier League this season and both have been from United; Tyler Blackcett in the 5-3 defeat by Leicester and Luke Shaw in the 1-1 draw with West Ham. Mark Clattenburg will officiate the Manchester derby between United and City at Old Trafford . The English referee sent off City and Belgium captain Vincent Kompany during the international break . Leicester 5-3 Manchester United . West Ham 1-1 Manchester United . Manchester United 3-0 Tottenham . Manchester City 3-1 West Ham . Liverpool 2-1 Manchester City . Chelsea 1-1 Manchester City . Clattenburg has courted controversy during his career but is generally regarded as one of the Premier League's leading referees alongside Michael Oliver. The champion's shock 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace on Monday saw United move a point above their local rivals to add extra incentive for both sides ahead of the derby at Old Trafford, which could ultimately decide who finishes second behind expected winners Chelsea. While Manuel Pellegrini's side have struggled since the turn of the year, turning from title challengers to fourth place chases, United are coasting on confidence having won their last five consecutive league games. Clattenburg will be joined on Sunday by assistants Simon Beck and Jake Collin, while Jonathan Moss will serve as the fourth official. Clattenburg has shown only two red cards this season, both to United players including Luke Shaw (centre)",

        "document": "Outspoken MP Bob Katter has risked being drawn into a race row after accusing the Queensland Government of believing embattled MP Billy Gordon was 'a little black puppet on a string'. In a bizarre statement on his party's website, Mr Katter said the Government believes Mr Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence - and later admitted to his criminal past. Mr Katter, federal MP for Kennedy, is of Lebanese descent. He said he's been personally subjected to racist attitudes from both major parties in the past, and that he sympathised with Mr Gordon's position. Federal MP Bob Katter, who released a statement today accusing the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence . Mr Gordon was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history from Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk . He announced on Wednesday he will remain in the Queensland parliament as an independent, throwing the Government, which holds a razor-thin majority, into chaos. 'In the last two cases where this occurred in the federal parliament, there was never any question raised about the member resigning. So why was it assumed here that Billy Gordon would resign?' Mr Katter's statement reads. 'I can't help but think that the Queensland Government thought they had a little black puppet on a string. Mr Gordon, who \u00a0was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history . The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with users questioning his terminology. 'Irrespective of his weird use of the term 'black puppet' it's kinda odd how Bob Katter is speaking on Billy Gordon's behalf' wrote Benjamin James. Not that John wrote: 'Wow, Bob Katter calls Billy Gordon, 'black puppet on a string' and the lefty loons stay silent. What if Abbott had said it?' The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with some users questioning his terminology . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet in light of his personal experiences . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet 'because I'm dark and I come from Cloncurry.' 'I can understand and I can identify with the attitudes that these people have and I'm going to call it for what it is,' he said. 'I deliberately put that comment in with a forethought, because I think they deserve a belting for the racial overtones.' Mr Katter used federal MPs Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott as examples of independents becoming puppets for the government and sacrificing their independence, but he vowed Mr Gordon would not make that mistake.",

Dayna Dobias, 19, from Downers Grove was born with cerebral palsy, but she hopes to inspire others with her enthusiastic videos. 'I've gotten bullied because of it and I get people all the time, staring and so it's definitely made things difficult in my life,' Dayna told Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Challenging: Dayna Dobias, 18, is hoping change the way people with disabilities are represented by the television, film and the fashion industry . Her hope is that the video not only entertains, but inspires others to think before judging. The teenager says her motivation for creating the video was to counteract stereotypes held by people over certain disabilities. 'People tend to think that because I have cerebral palsy I cannot do anything and that I am so different from everyone else, when in reality I am pretty much just the same as everyone else,' she added. 'I might do things a little bit differently than most people, but that doesn't mean that I should be treated differently.' This is one of several videos that Dayna has created. Last year the teenager produced another dancing clip with her strutting her stuff to Taylor Swift's Shake It Off. Inspirational: The Illinois teen who suffers from cerebal palsy has created a video in which she dances . Don't judge: People tend to think that because I have cerebral palsy I cannot do anything and that I am so different from everyone else, when in reality I am pretty much just the same as everyone else,' Dayna says . 'People like to define me based on disability. People just look at me and think, oh that's just the girl with cerebral palsy,' she said. 'I would like people to look past that and be like, oh she's just one of us.' Dayna says she wanted to turn any negativity that might be held over her disability into something positive and hopefully inspire others, or at the very least raise a smile. 'When I was first diagnosed with cerebral palsy, doctors warned my parents that I may never walk, but here I am dancing! I drive, I go to college, I do things like every other 19-year-old,' she says. The teen has now begun to do some motivational speaking at a couple of local schools. Confident: Dayna has now taken up motivational speaking and has visited several schools in the Chicago area .",

The Iowa Board of Chiropractic released a report Wednesday detailing charges against Charles Manuel, of Lamoni. Manuel signed an agreement last month admitting his misdeeds and pledging not to apply for reinstatement for at least 10 years. Patient satisfaction: A chiropractor in Iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients. Nonetheless, he's received outstanding evaluations for patient satisfaction on HealthGrades.com . The agreement requires that Manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to Manuel's home from the Des Moines Register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time. A Lamoni address listed on the Yelp page for Manuel's practice appears to be a home on a residential street.

On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were \"unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,\" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will \"file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels\" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it \"one of the most dangerous close passes in decades.\" The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident. Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other, both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska. CNN's Steve Brusk and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.",

        "document": "An FBI agent's sniper rifle (similar to the one pictured) was ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot . An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. 'The rifle had been secured properly,' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure. Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon.' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag, backpack, and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft, which the police report states happened overnight. The theft happened just a week before Obama (pictured during his visit) made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month . Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car, as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case. The agent's bags and some of his clothing were found at a Residence Inn across the street, but the sniper rifle has not been recovered. Marriott Springhill Suites, the agent's hotel, is next to the city's airport and just down the street from the state's FBI office. The hotel does not have surveillance cameras, according to the police report. Salt Lake City police said the rifle's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer. The Secret Service told Fox 13 Salt Lake City the agency was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama's visit, but could not comment if the theft prompted an increase of security. Det. McGowan said police do not know if the thief specifically targeted the agent's car. The sniper rifle was stolen sometime overnight from the parking lot of\u00a0Marriott Springhill Suites, where the agent was staying. The hotel is just across the street from the state's FBI office .",

He also said the trail of faeces from the crime scene  to the toilet were police found Costa suggested his confused mental state.

The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick \u2013 awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon \u2013 rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch . Barkley's effort is saved by\u00a0Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park . Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, he would have taken it. Otherwise, I am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how they feel at that moment,' argued the Everton manager. Baines (left)\u00a0has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League . 'Ross showed incredible responsibility to take it. I love seeing players take control of the big moments and Leighton was happy to given him that responsibility.' Barkley's penalty was well-struck but wasn't put in the corner and Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton dived to his right to save.

        "document": "Esteban Cambiasso has won all the major European competitions a player can during his illustrious career but revealed that keeping Leicester City in the Premier League would be up there with the best. The Foxes are currently seven points adrift at the bottom of the table, with only eight games remaining, knowing that time is running out to save themselves. Cambiasso refuses to give up and admits that keeping Leicester up will feel like winning a trophy. Esteban Cambiasso says that helping keep Leicester in the Premier League will feel like winning a trophy . 'For me, it's like another cup,' he told BBC East Midlands Today. 'When you start another season you have an objective, and this is the objective for us. 'For me, winning a cup or winning the league with another team is the same now as having the possibility to save Leicester in the Premier League.' The Argentinian midfielder poses with the trophy after his team won the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup . Cambiasso had an illustrious career at Inter Milan, winning an impressive 15 trophies during his stint . River Plate (2001-2002) Argentine Primera Division . Real Madrid (2002-2004) La Liga . Super Cup . Supercopa de Espana . Inter Milan (2004-2014) Champions League . Serie A (5) Coppa Italia (4) Supercoppa (4) FIFA Club World Cup . Having not won a game since January, Nigel Pearson's men face West Ham United on Saturday and Cambiasso is still convinced they can avoid the drop. 'I understood when I signed for Leicester it's not an easy job to stay in the Premier League,' he said. 'It's a difficult situation but I think we have our chances to win matches. There's a quarter of the Premier League left to finish. 'I think some people think for Leicester all is finished. But I'm sure, because I watch my team-mates every day, we can save Leicester and stay in the Premier League.' The former Inter Milan star signed for the Foxes in the summer, leaving Italy after ten years and embarking on a new challenge in England. After agreeing to a one-year-deal, Cambiasso has quickly established himself as a key player but it remains to be seen if he'll still be in the East Midlands at the start of next season. The former Real Madrid man was also successful during his short spell in Spain for Real Madrid . Cambiasso played during Real's 'Galatico' era, with Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham . 'Leicester always wanted me,' he added. 'After these nine months or eight months, I'm very happy because my family is OK, and I'm good. 'I want a few more points, but all the rest is perfect.' Cambiasso is happy in the East Midlands and could stay beyond his current one-year-deal .",

The woman, named only as Gemma, has two children under five by two different fathers and handed both infants over to her 52-year-old mother Debbie when they were four months old. Now Debbie is threatening to ban Gemma from seeing the children at all, after discovering her daughter's penchant for legal high, MKat, and because she suspects her of stealing. Scroll down for video . Feckless: 23-year-old Gemma faces being prevented from seeing her children by her own mother . 'I love them,' says Debbie of the two children. 'She [Gemma] isn't fit enough to have them. She doesn't care.' Debbie, who stepped in to care for the children after social services threatened to take them away, says her daughter's constant drinking and partying is getting out of hand. She also claims that Gemma, who is unemployed, stole an iPad from one of the children and sold it to fund her party lifestyle. Although Gemma says she did not steal the device, she admits to stealing money and other items from her mother in the past. 'From around the age of 13, she went off the rails,' says Debbie. 'She was drinking beer and having underage sex. Upset: Debbie reacts after hearing the results of Gemma's lie detector test - which revealed she did steal . Furious: Debbie, who has looked after Gemma's children all their lives, says she will ban her from the house . 'With the children, she was excited about being pregnant but gave up about four months after having them and then dumped the babies on me.' As a result, Debbie, who appeared alongside her daughter on The Jeremy Kyle Show, has been left to bring both children up alone. Now at the end of her tether, Debbie says she is preparing to ban Gemma from her home and from seeing the children - because she can't trust her not pinch their possessions. Upset: According to her mother, Gemma prefers drinking and parties to work and motherhood . 'I don't know how you could do that to your own kid,' adds Debbie, who also revealed that Gemma's children call her mum and not grandma. 'She doesn't care. She doesn't care at all and I feel awful about it because at the end of the day, they're my grandchildren and I love them. 'She's missed out from day one. She doesn't put them first.

Chelsea captain John Terry had come in with a strong challenge from behind on United striker Radamel Falcao which sent the Colombian hurtling to the ground. Blues midfielder Cesc Fabregas then collected the loose ball and released it to Oscar before his back-heel sent it into the path of the oncoming Hazard to slot home. Chelsea defender John Terry comes in from behind with a strong challenge on Radamel Falcao . Terry's challenge on Falcao came during the build-up to Eden Hazard's opening goal for Chelsea . The Manchester United striker struggles to hold his grand and loses the ball to Terry near the half-way line . Terry's strong challenge leads to a loose ball that is picked up by Cesc Fabregas to start of the scoring move . Without taking anything away from the sublime spectacle of the goal, pundits Thierry Henry, Jamie Redknapp and Graeme Souness agreed during their half-time analysis that play should have been stopped for Terry's rough tackle on Falcao. Souness said, 'It's a decent forearm smash. I mean he does stick his elbow in the back of Falcao's head and that's a foul.' He added, 'If that elbow's not there he's not going down like that.' Former Arsenal captain Henry, meanwhile, felt sympathy for Falcao as a fellow striker. Asked if he would have wanted a foul in that position as a player, the Frenchman responded, 'Yes, all day long.' Finally, Redknapp admitted that while Falcao could have possibly done better to stay on his feet, Terry's challenge from behind shouldn't have gone unpunished. 'I think he could have been stronger, but it's still a foul.' Sky pundits Graeme Souness (left), Thierry Henry (centre) and Jamie Redknapp agree Terry fouled Falcao .",

        "document": "(CNN)Lady Antebellum singer Hillary Scott's tour bus caught fire on a Texas freeway Thursday morning, but everyone on board was safely evacuated. Michael Barnett captured dramatic video of the fire, on Interstate 30 just northeast of Dallas, and uploaded it to CNN iReport. Smoke and flames poured from the rear of the bus as traffic slowed to a crawl and Barnett slowly approached in his vehicle. As he drew closer to the bus, Barnett decided to stop filming because he didn't know what to expect. \"It was shocking,\" he said. \"I didn't know what I was about to see. I didn't know if anyone was hurt.\" Barnett said he didn't realize at the time that the bus belonged to the country band. Hillary Scott, co-lead singer for the band, posted a photo of the charred bus on Instagram and noted that she, her husband, the tour manager and the driver were all evacuated safely. \"Thanking God for our safety and the safety of all of those who helped put this fire out and keep us safe,\" she wrote. The tour manager told CNN affiliate KTVT that the bus stopped after a rear tire blew out. It burst into flames after everyone had gotten off. Scott also posted an Instagram photo and message saying that the fire destroyed everything in the bus's back lounge except her Bible. The band's two other members, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, were not traveling on the bus, KTVT reported. Lady Antebellum is set to perform at the 50th Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday in Arlington, Texas.",

        "document": "Space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction, and even the odd Bond movie. But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.",

        "document": "A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard)\u00a0was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'",

        "document": "(CNN)Donald Sterling's racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year. But now it's his former female companion who has lost big. A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. \"This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress,\" attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement. \"It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts.\" Stiviano's gifts from Donald Sterling didn't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. \"In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,\" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. \"Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,\" Sterling said. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise.

        "document": "Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal's recent dealings in the transfer window and has urged his former side to purchase four top players in the summer. The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack . Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing . Hull (away) - May 4 . Swansea (home) - May 11 . Man United (away) - May 17 . Sunderland (home) May 20 . West Brom (home) - May 24 . Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand . 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry . Giroud, pictured during Arsenal's match against Chelsea, has scored 14 Premier League goals this season .",

        "document": "A young accountant fell down a 70ft cliff to his death when he ran from a taxi to avoid paying the fare. Graduate Jacob Phillips, 23, plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December \u2013 but didn\u2019t have enough cash to pay for it. An inquest heard he ran from the driver, who gave chase at the seaside town of Penarth, South Wales. Cabbie Dave Sidaway told the inquest: \u2018I stopped because I couldn\u2019t see where I was going. I had no idea how much danger he was in.\u2019 Jacob Phillips, 23, was found dead at the end of the disused Northern Promenade, a rocky area at the base of the cliff . The university graduate had been out drinking in Cardiff before catching a taxi with friends Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson. Cardiff Coroner\u2019s Court heard how the trio got out of the taxi to \u2018use an ATM\u2019 before making a run for it. \u2018The plan was to go to Penarth but we did not have enough money for the taxi \u2013 I ran off in one direction, Jacob went in another direction,\u2019 Mr Robinson told the inquest. \u2018Running away from the taxi was a stupid thing to do.\u2019 Mr Phillips, of Reading, Berks, was discovered the next day on the rocky beach by a dog walker. Paramedics arrived at the scene after his body was discovered in the morning by a dog walker . A long way down: Mr Phillips fell down this cliff after a night out. \u00a0Tthe taxi driver said he would not have left him if he knew where they were . Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Andrew Barkley said: \u2018It is likely that he became disorientated and there is no evidence that he knew where he was at the time. \u2018There is no way he could have known the danger that lay in front of him. The following day with the benefit of light it was clear the danger he faced by the sheer drop off the cliff just yards beyond the fence.\u2019 Mr Phillips worked for Pretty Green, the clothing label run by Oasis star Liam Gallagher. He had grown up in Barry, South Wales, before studying accountancy at the University of Birmingham. The inquest heard that he had returned to Wales for Christmas and had been staying with his mother in the upmarket Cowbridge area. Mr Phillips had planned to stay at a friend\u2019s house but he and his friends didn\u2019t have enough money to complete the journey, so decided to trick the driver by \u2018dodging\u2019 the fare. Mr Phillips ran off into the \u2018pitch black\u2019 and fell down a cliff at the end of the disused Northern Promenade \u2013 also called The Dardanelles. Police search the scene at the bottom of the cliff where his body was discovered .",

        "document": "Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer\u2019s passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation. At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a \u00a342 million profit during the chaos, received up to \u00a33,500 in bonuses. Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips. Scroll down for video . The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer . Keith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: \u2018I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.\u2019 The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system. Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra \u00a330 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time. Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office. In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was \u00a3203,066, giving an average sum of \u00a392.68. The biggest single payout was \u00a35,463; the lowest \u00a31. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of \u2018the system failure of our customer complaint database\u2019. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: \u2018It would create a precedent.\u2019 Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved . This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back. Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to \u00a31,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time \u2013 even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades. HM Passport Office made a surplus of \u00a342.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of \u00a31.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward \u00a3499 and the highest \u00a33,500.",
