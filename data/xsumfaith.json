He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US.\n\"Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit,\" Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said.\n\"He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder. And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director.\"\nThe AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: \"I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing. Christopher provided a fantastic legacy for me to build upon when I joined in 2006 and I know he will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him.\"\nSpeaking to Sean Rafferty on Radio 3's In Tune, soprano Dame Emma Kirkby said: \"Some of the best players that now lead orchestras all over the world, they started with him.\n\"Chris was a natural academic, an incredibly clever man. He had an amazing capacity to absorb information of all kinds and a really sure sense of how things would be if he really tried to reproduce conditions... a very genial person.\"\nDavid Thomas from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London added: \"He always said I want the music to speak for itself because it can, it's good enough, it will\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a very pleasant and lovely man.\"",

There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.\nIn an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: \"Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.\n\"It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.\"\nThe BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.\nSpeaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: \"The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.\n\"Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.\n\"Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).\n\"The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.\"",

        "document": "It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points.\nThis, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid.\nListen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality\nThe slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine.\nNow, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit.\nThis is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history.\nIn 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races.\nThey dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99.\nAmazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'.\nThey should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari.\nBut although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information.\nThere was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan.\nUntil 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too.\nIn many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline.\nTheir first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970.\nTheir maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda.\nBut then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now.\nSo alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another.\nDennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season.\nSo far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again?\nDennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return.\nIt is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title.\nThis, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007.\nThe Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end.\nDennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too.\nThey can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver \"championships, plural\", as Dennis puts it.\nBut right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",

        "document": "Let's not forget the traditional argument with your other half about whose job it was to buy all the batteries for the children's new toys - which are currently a source of tension because nobody can turn them on.\nAm I right?\nIf that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online:\nEveryday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed.\nSo far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker.\n\"There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,\" he says.\n\"The chat room is like the foyer of a church.\"\nVirtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included:\nIts first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons.\n\"We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,\" says Mr Parker.\n\"The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.\"\nThe Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website.\nGuardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union.\nThe game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release.\n\"Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,\" he says.\n\"The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around.\n\"It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world.\"\nYou get the idea.\nSpecial content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus.\nThere are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits.\nGerman marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times.\nThere are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable.\nThe whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins.\nHighlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card.\nThe Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times.\n\"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network.\n\"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\"\nHowever, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious\".\nAfter distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language.\nThe book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah.\nIt is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees.\n\"We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,\" says founder Roald Lidal.\n\"One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,\" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years.\n\"There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.\"\nAs if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year.\n\"I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,\" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier.\n\"The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.\"\n\"Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,\" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex.\n\"He was a great communicator.\"\nSounds like a seal of approval to me.",

Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nA spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny.\n\"All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya.\nRamzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them \"lies\". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya.\nThe Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that \"retribution\" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April.\n\"There will be retribution!\" he told the Russian news website RBC. \"Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.\"\nNovaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters.\nIn an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya.\n\"We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,\" he wrote, urging dialogue.\nChechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova.\nBut much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya.\nThe LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses.\nIf Russia fails to prosecute anyone, it says it will file a case at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.",

        "document": "The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline.\nThe NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday.\nNAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August.\nLighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing.\nLast week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: \"I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.\"\nBut the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed.\nAt the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before.\nRules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified.\n\"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\"\nDuring his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: \"I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands.\"\nThe NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision.\nMcGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin.\nBut Bennett says he studied a \"litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \"several reasons to approve the fight\".\nBennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion.\n\"I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett. \"He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer.\n\"Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer.\n\"Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself.\n\"That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight.\"\nMcGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier.\nSince sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: \"He's good to go.\"\nHe also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73.\nCortez said he oversaw an \"out of control\" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.",

        "document": "It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters.\nIt has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain's own defences.\nFor now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves.\nU33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships.\nTheir task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker.\nWhen they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds.\nUp on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search.\nHe says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity.\nThere have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK.\nHe says the training \"focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare\".\nFor the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy.\nIt has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack.\nUp on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope.\nDown below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors.\nLieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship.\nHe says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines.\nBut when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: \"I wouldn't want to comment on that,\" before adding: \"In general, we're always on the lookout.\"\nNato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy.\nBut this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength.\nWhile many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his.\nRussia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters.\nEarlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the \"quietest submarine in the world\".\nPeter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development.\nHe describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled.\nThey are, he says, the \"quietest and most challenging adversary in the world\".\nWhen out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time.\nOften the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves.\nThey lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and \"fingerprinting\" other nations' submarines and warships.\nFor this exercise, curiously named \"Dynamic Mongoose\", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search.\nFor the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean.\nScientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed.\nIt is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea.\nRyan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise.\nThey are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance.\nUnderwater drones are for the future.\nBut for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft.\nThese are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean.\nFor this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft.\nInside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below.\nBritain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences.\nSeveral times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters.\nRUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a \"key vulnerability\".\nHe says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland.\nBritain, he says, should be \"exceptionally worried\" that it is seen as a \"soft touch\", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace.\nThe purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare.\nBut it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone.\nThe lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review.\nThe search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.",

There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland.\n\"And we are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of that\".\nHe welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill, but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which he said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign.\nThere were lighters moments as Mr Salmond, who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget, joked that he was aware that he faced competition from a \"major attraction down south today\".\nHe then added: \"However, on balance, I feel that the champion chase at Cheltenham racecourse will not be overshadowed by my remarks.\"\nAnd the former SNP leader joked that he wished everyone standing in the forthcoming election good luck, \"albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm\".\nHe concluded his address by saying: \"Let me leave you with these final thoughts - there is no greater honour in public life than to be a member of this parliament.\n\"There is no greater task than to mould the public purpose of Scotland. There is no greater cause than to serve the people of this country.\n\"And so with that it is goodbye from me... for now\".\nMs Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for his contribution both as an MSP and as first minister, and added that he had \"served the parliament and Scotland with distinction\".\nThe presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil, who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since it was established in 1999.\nMr McNeil used his address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly with regard to the committee system.\nHe said: \"It will be this parliament's responsibility to ensure there is accountability, there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary.\n\"We must ensure we are capable of meeting that challenge, or we will face the consequences.\"\nHe recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster.\nBut Mr McNeil said: \"It saddens me to say we now have to do a bit of learning from them and how they run their business.\"\nFormer Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood.\nIn her speech, she joked she would miss her dealings with Finance Secretary John Swinney, especially \"his huge outbursts of faux indignation\".",

A good decision and in my opinion the right time.\"\nThere was also support for Hitzlsperger from leading figures in German football administration.\n\"Finally, a footballer has the courage to make his sexuality public,\" said Theo Zwanziger, the former president of the German Football Association.\nBundesliga president Reinhard Rauball said in a statement: \"The decision of Thomas Hitzlsperger to be the first prominent footballer to make public his homosexuality is - even after his active career - a huge and courageous step, and surely leads the way in the fight against homophobia.\"\nGary Lineker \u200f@GaryLineker\nCongratulations to Thomas Hitzlsperger on bravely being the first player to have played in the PL to 'come out'\nJoseph Barton \u200f@Joey7Barton 15m\nThomas Hitzlsperger has shown a lot of courage today. Sad times when people have to wait till they retire from their chosen profession...\n...before the feel other people will judge them solely on who the human being is. Shame on all of us as a society.\nJohn Amaechi OBE \u200f@JohnAmaechi\nCongratulations to Thomas Hitzlsperger - welcome to the club!\nBayern Munich, the club where Hitzlsperger began his career as a junior, also tweeted their support for the midfielder's \"brave step\".\nHitzlsperger's announcement is seen as a watershed moment in Germany, which like England has struggled with the problem of homophobia in football.\nZwanziger admitted that football was \"now as ever a hard business, where unfortunately an open discourse about homosexuality is still not taken for granted\".\nCurrent Germany captain Philipp Lahm created controversy in 2011 when he wrote in his autobiography that he would encourage gay footballers to keep quiet about their sexuality.\n\"I would not encourage any gay professional footballer to come out,\" he wrote at the time. \"I would fear that he would end up like Justin Fashanu [the English footballer who killed himself after revealing that he was gay].\"\nThe last German footballer to come out was second tier player Marcus Urban, who told Die Welt in 2007 that he knew of at least three gay footballers in the Bundesliga who were too scared to reveal their sexuality.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert praised Hitzlsperger for going public.\n\"It's good that he's spoken about something which is important to him,\" Seibert told a media briefing.\n\"We live in a country where nobody should be worried about making his sexuality known or concerned about intolerance.\n\"We judge footballers on whether they have behaved well and worthily on and off the pitch and I believe that both are the case with Mr Hitzlsperger.\"\nOpenly Gay German politician Volker Beck said he hoped Hitzlsperger's announcement would encourage others to do the same.\n\"I hope that Hitzlsperger's courageous step contributes to finally breaking down this taboo,\" he said. \"It's now the job of the German FA to embolden active players [to do the same].\"\nAnd Zwanziger said he was optimistic that Hitzlsperger's announcement would lead to greater openness about sexuality in German football.\nHe said: \"I'm confident that sexual orientations will soon not be an issue in football at all.\"",

I'm rather perplexed by this debate, which has been going in the UK for some time, because I view taxes as not optional.\n\"I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required. It's not a debate. You pay the taxes.\n\"If the British system changes the tax laws, then we will comply. If the taxes go up, we will pay more, if they go down, we will pay less. That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom.\"\nMeanwhile, the head of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge, has suggested a new committee should be established to oversee the tax arrangements of major firms.\nShe told the Independent newspaper that such a committee could hear evidence from companies in secret, meaning that companies would not be able to hide their tax affairs behind confidentiality rules.\nGoogle, most of whose UK sales are routed through Ireland, is one of the multinationals strongly criticised for organising their tax affairs in ways that minimise the amounts they pay in the UK.\nLast week, European Union leaders agreed to tackle tax avoidance through an \"automatic information exchange between tax authorities\" to monitor the situation.\nThe Google chairman has previously argued that corporate taxes should be levied in the country where it conducts economic activity and takes risks, rather than where products are consumed.\nHe has also called for a debate on international tax reform.\n\"Politicians - not companies - [should] set the rules...When legislators are doing the lobbying and companies are articulating the law as it stands, it's a confusing spectacle for everyone,\" he recently wrote in the Observer.\n\"Our hope is to move the debate forward, with everyone engaged constructively in developing a clearer, simpler system - one in which companies that abide by the law know that the politicians who devised the rules are willing to defend and commend them.\"",

The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.\nAlessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor \"came out of nowhere\", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - \"medium-strong\" and \"fairly shallow\".\nItaly is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila.\nSix scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement.\nThe group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided \"inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory\" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake.\nAt a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely.\nOn the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.",

The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment.\nAt the time, Jak wrote: \"This is the saddest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days/weeks/months/years I can get. They can't give me a timescale to how long I have.\n\"I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it.\n\"I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past six months, they have tried their best for me.\"\nIn the days after he received the news, Jak's family urged people to donate to a fundraising page for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research.\nAfter becoming ill Jak also visited the Kelpies, enjoyed a romantic meal with his girlfriend, went to a party in his honour which was attended by Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo, and spent time in a supercar and on a quad bike.\nMore money is expected to be raised for charity on Sunday at a special football match being held at the Energy Assets Arena, home of Livingston FC.",

The children also sang Happy Birthday.\nPrime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions.\nMr Cameron said Thursday was an \"important landmark\", adding the monarch had served the nation with \"dignity\".\nIn an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: \"The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be.\"\nThe prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as \"work-shy William\".\nHe said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart.\n\"I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,\" he said.\nHe said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so.\n'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview\nBBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell\nThe recent headlines about William being a \"work shy\" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him.\nIn the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response.\nHe accepts that he will be criticised \"but it's not something I take completely to heart\".\nAn indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions.\nIt was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself.\nThere was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be.\nWhen asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was \"the best role model I could have in front of me\".\nFull details of Queen's birthday celebrations\nTen stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family.\nThe picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year.\nSix further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role.\nOn her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance.\nIt was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months.\nIn the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday.\nOn Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle.\nBritain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June.\nRepublic said the Queen's birthday \"does not warrant this kind of coverage\" and that the BBC had a \"duty to report, not to celebrate the royals\".\nGraham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had \"failed completely\" to report the birthday in a way that was \"fair, balanced and proportionate\".",

He should be incredibly proud.\"\nClarke, 34, confirmed his decision to retire after his side surrendered the Ashes with a heavy defeat by England at Trent Bridge, which gave the hosts a 3-1 lead.\nSmith had already captained the side in three Tests against India last summer, when Clarke was recovering from hamstring surgery and back issues.\nThe New South Welshman has played in 32 Tests for his country, scoring 2,952 runs at an average of 54.66.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"When Michael made his decision to retire last week it was a very straightforward decision for us to nominate Steve as his successor,\" added Marsh.\n\"He has big shoes to fill but everything about him suggests he is the right man for the job.\"\nWarner has earned the vice-captain's role despite a history of disciplinary problems, and Marsh said of the opener: \"David has matured and developed into an important senior figure in the Australian team. He has come a long way.\n\"We believe that he will respond well to the added responsibility of leadership.\"\nSmith and Warner will lead Australia in the limited-overs matches that follow the final Ashes Test at the Oval, which starts on 20 August.",

        "document": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections.\nIt is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999.\nIt lost the presidential poll last month for the first time.\nAPC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan.\nThe PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja.\nThe party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo.\nIt also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency.\nHowever, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub.\nThe PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east.\nTaraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory.\nElections were not held in seven states.\nAnalysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja\nThe APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.\nHowever, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.\nIn parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.\nWhy Jonathan lost?\nBuhari's historic victory\nNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.\nMost of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.\nOn Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.\nIt means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.\nOur correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.\nThe party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.\nIt had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.\nThe PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.",

        "document": "Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat.\nThe hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes.\nFirst, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster.\nSouthampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time.\nThe win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury.\nBut his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it.\nInstantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction.\nThe mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years.\nThat run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768.\nEmpty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players.\nYet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour.\nSouthampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges.\nAustin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge.\nVirgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark.\nThat was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire.\nThe Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort.\nDawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar.\nHull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough.\n\"The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character.\n\"Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation.\n\"After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future.\n\"We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult. We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game.\"\nFollowing the international break, Hull return to action with a trip to bottom side Sunderland on Saturday, 19 November (15:00 GMT), while on the same day Southampton play host to leaders Liverpool, also at 15:00.\nMatch ends, Hull City 2, Southampton 1.\nSecond Half ends, Hull City 2, Southampton 1.\nDelay over.

        "document": "The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000.\nThe aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe.\nIn particular, the project wants every school to have a connection.\nBuilding so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus.\nIt can take Europe\u2019s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today\u2019s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost.\nThat means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes.\nThe idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece.\nThe boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy.\n\"Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc.\n\"Here, we\u2019ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,\" he told BBC News.\nAirbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida.\nThe most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the \"revolution\" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan.\nThe first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year.\nAnother batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace.\nThe establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight.\nMore than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth.\nThere should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade.\nOneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage.\nEquity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a \"truly global company\" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority.\n\"A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,\" said OneWeb CEO Eric B\u00e9ranger.\n\"And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries.\"\nOne aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions.\nThe fear is that space could eventually become unusable.\nA recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other.\nBrian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation.\n\"We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit.\"\nTime will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole.\nAirbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment.\n\"Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,\u201d said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

        "document": "For many people with severe disabilities, their families and carers, this is a reality they are faced with every time they leave the house.\nIn some cases it can leave them feeling isolated and unable to enjoy the simplest of everyday activities that we take for granted just because they haven't got a suitable area to spend a penny.\nOrdinary accessible toilets may be the answer for many independent wheelchair users - but what about those who need two carers to help them or need a hoist to help them transfer on to a bench to change rather than a toilet?\"\nRecommendations are in place to support installing Changing Places toilets with enhanced facilities when designing larger buildings such as shopping centres, cinemas and leisure facilities - but campaigners are calling for these to be made compulsory.\nLorna Fillingham, mother of six-year-old Emily-May, is concerned about the lack of truly accessible toilet facilities in town centres and has started a petition to campaign for changes in building regulations to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory\n\"It's like playing Russian roulette,\" Lorna says. \"Knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren't suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful.\n\"My daughter is only six so she doesn't have any knowledge of what she is going to be put through, but I know and the thought of that makes me feel so guilty.\"\nLorna has also submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee who are currently gathering evidence about how accessible the built environment is for disabled people.\nThere are currently 893 Changing Places toilets in the UK but what exactly are they?\nThey are different from standard disabled toilets as they have extra features and more space to help meet  the needs of people who use them.\nMike LeSurf, Changing Places Development Officer at Mencap says: \"There are potentially over a quarter of a million people who need a Changing Places toilet - because behind the standard accessible toilet door, people's needs are not being met.\"\nAlison Beevers describes the psychological effect on the whole family of not having an appropriate place for a change as her son Freddie gets older and their options for outings are slowly flushed away.\n\"Imagine having to get down on your hands and knees and laying down on a dirty floor or squashing yourself into the back of your car just because there isn't a bench and hoist in the toilet,\" she says.\n\"You just begin to get this sense of feeling like you're last in the line to be considered.\n\"It's soul-destroying and you don't feel like a valued member of society at all.\"\nBut it is not all doom and gloom and Alison gets by with a little help from her friends.\nShe said: \"Freddie went to a party and one of my friends converted a room into a 'pop-up' changing places, and brought stuff from home to kit it out - it was amazing\"\nAlison even tweeted from the party: \"Friends for life are those who organise parties in the village hall and provide a 'pop up' #changingplace so ALL can go!\"\nBethan Folen and her daughter Lowri also enjoy their \"girls' days out\" now there are more convenient and fully accessible places to change nearby.\nShe said: \"Lowri's favourite thing to do is to go to the Millennium Stadium [now known as the Principality Stadium] in Cardiff and watch Wales play rugby. She is a massive fan.\nEven before the stadium installed its Changing Places toilet, says Bethan, \"There were some nearby in the centre of Cardiff and it made things so much easier whenever we needed to change Lowri\"\nChanging Places specifications have been included in the Building Standards guidelines (BS 8300:2009) since 2009 as a recommendation rather than a compulsory requirement.\nArchitect Vaila Morrison explains why this creates a problem.\n\"By making it compulsory to have a Changing Places toilet in larger complexes then you will give people clarity over what is expected as there is none at the moment,\" she says.\n\"As a designer you tend to focus on what you have to do in line with compulsory legislation and recommendations can be ignored because of this.\"\nFor businesses, especially those in already existing buildings, logistical and financial barriers to installing these toilets can sometimes block plans.\nAt 12 square metres (3m x 4m) Changing Places are considerably larger than the standard accessible toilet (1,5m x 2.2m).\nBecause of this campaigners are focusing their efforts on making it compulsory for newly built larger complexes such as shopping centres, cinemas and sports stadiums in the building regulations.\nArsenal Football Club, who were the first side in the Premier League to install a Changing Places toilet, have seen a very positive reaction not just from fans but from the general public too.\nAlun Francis, Disability Liaison Officer at the club, said: \"There were challenges and despite already having 38 wheelchair accessible toilets we were constrained by the original building design as it existed before the recommendations came in, so we had to adapt.\n\"But working with the people behind the Changing Places group was such a positive experience.\n\"They looked at our ideas to convert two of the existing toilets into one Changing Place and helped us find a way around things so we could make it possible.\n\"You need to think about all of your customers when you run any type of venue and if you want their custom you have to make things accessible for them - it's important.\"",

        "document": "It also warns that Britain may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall deal.\nFishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favour of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign.\nThe Lords review says these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations.\nThe EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), with its quotas and principle of equal access to commercial fishing grounds for boats from all member states, has often been characterised by the industry as a disaster for Britain.\nThis dislike helped mobilise many in the industry to campaign for a leave vote in the referendum last June.\nMany in the fishing community argue that Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, like Norway.\nHowever, the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that looks at the risks and opportunities for the UK industry.\nSince UK fishing only produces a half of one percent of GDP and employs just 12,000 fishers, the Lords say that industry might be a low priority for the government but it \"must not be marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations\".\nWhat complicates the picture is the fact the most commercial fish stocks are in waters that are shared between the UK and other EU coastal states. The vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported, often from EU states.\n\"A successful industry,\" the report says, \"therefore needs continued market access.\"\nHowever, that access may come at a price.\n\"Brexit will involve many trade-offs,\" said Lord Teverson who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee.\n\"It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fishers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs.\"\nThe report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states.\nOne area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away \"raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes\" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nHowever, many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats.\nJust this week, the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock and prawns.\nResponding to the new quotas, representatives from the industry said they believed this augurs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU.\n\"With Brexit now looming, fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,\" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said in a statement.\n\"This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management, which will benefit our coastal communities.\"\nIn response to the report, a government spokesperson said: \"As we enter the EU negotiations, the prime minister has been clear we want to ensure British companies have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market.\"\n\"At the same time, leaving the EU is a real opportunity to review fisheries management in order to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks and a healthy marine environment.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook",

Syria is in war, and the Americans and others have to take this into consideration.\"\nHe described as \"absolutely unacceptable\" US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent condemnation of the government's use of barrel bombs in the city of Aleppo.\nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims 246 people, including 73 children, have been killed in Aleppo in the last five days alone after barrels containing explosives and metal fragments were dropped by military helicopters.\nActivist group The Aleppo Media Centre claims 14 people were killed in barrel bomb attacks on the Masaken Hanano district on Thursday, citing footage appearing to show bombs being dropped from a helicopter onto a civilian area.\n\"We are defending our people against terrorist attacks. We have never bombarded places with civilians,\" Mr Mekdad insisted, accusing the US of \"still supporting terrorist elements\" in the country.\nThe Syrian government, via state media, also denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition, dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, mounted the assault, freeing hundreds of detainees.\nBut state television insisted soldiers and security forces had \"thwarted an attack against the prison by terrorist groups\".\nThe Observatory says fighting is still going on, but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre, a citizen-journalist outlet, say rebels now completely control the prison.\nIt is reported to hold at least 3,000 detainees, including Islamists, activists and minors, in horrific conditions.\nSyria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons.\nThe US said last week that so far only about 4% of the stockpile - 30 tonnes - had left the country.\nUS Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said he was \"concerned\" that the UN-backed plan was falling behind schedule and said Damascus \"had to take responsibility for fulfilling its commitment\".\nRussia - a key ally of Syria - has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March.\nA deadline was set last year for all the weapons to be destroyed by the end of June.\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is overseeing the destruction operation, has admitted the process has been slowed down by security concerns.\nMr Mekdad stressed: \"Syria is committed to all its agreements, with the OPCW and the UN Security Council.

        "document": "But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices.\nThe study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools.\nMany pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations.\nThe rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home.\nTablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group.\nBut researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.\nThe highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.\nThe underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.\nBut Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.\nResearchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.\nBut Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.\nAnd there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.\nDr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.\n\"The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,\" she said.\nA separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read.\nIt showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books.\nThe study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people.\nWithin a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet \"addicts\".\nAbout two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos.\nFindings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children.\nIt showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home.\nSimon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools.\nEach pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home.\nUsing these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in \"the current century and not the last\".\nThe benefits are \"difficult to put into league tables\", he says. But they create a \"sense of empowerment\" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel \"trusted and valued\".\nTablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on.\nThe head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work.\n\"I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,\" said Mr Mason.",

        "document": "It decided to reorganise the way patients were diagnosed by GPs and specialists by bringing in a new approach, especially to deal with those cancer cases which are not initially obvious.\nA team of cancer specialists, GPs, NHS and public health experts from Wales have just returned from a fact-finding visit to Aarhus, Denmark's second city.\nSo what was the problem?\nProf Frede Olesen of Aarhus University said the changes followed \"quite alarming\" cancer survival statistics more than 15 years ago showing Denmark was performing poorly compared to other European countries, including the rest of Scandinavia.\nPart of the problem was that waiting times patients faced before getting diagnosed were too long.\nIt was not so much the most serious cases where patients came to the GP with obvious symptoms. They could be fast-tracked to specialists in hospital.\nIt was the cancer cases where patients either had vague or more difficult to diagnose symptoms - or the small number of cancers found in patients who said they were ill but mostly needed a quick test or scan to rule something serious out.\n\"We looked at 30,000 cancer cases - and more than 25% of all cancer cases were from this group where we didn't think it was something but it suddenly showed as being something and so it's important to find those cases,\" said Prof Olesen.\nWhat were the changes?\nThe model of care introduced in Denmark has three routes.\nFirst -  for patients with \" alarm\" symptoms of specific cancers - there are fast-track diagnosis and treatment routes with strict time targets.\nIn addition to that, by law, any patient with a physical illness in Denmark must be investigated within 30 days of a GP referral.\nSecond, the Danish health service from 2007 set up diagnosis centres - at existing hospitals and clinics - where patients with symptoms which GPs cannot diagnose are given a range of tests and scans quickly to find out what is wrong with them, whether it is cancer or something else.\nGP Dr Hanne Heje, who works in Aarhus - a city slightly smaller than Cardiff - said the new system helps doctors who suspect something is wrong but not necessarily cancer.\nIt also stops the \"ping pong\" between GPs and different specialists.\n\"Now we know there's a department meeting the patient with open arms saying 'we welcome you', even though there's not a diagnosis written on their forehead,\" she said.\nThe third route deals with the group of patients with minor symptoms, which are very unlikely to be cancer but in rare cases could be.\nThese patients go to so-called \"yes-no\" centres which offer a simple test or scan so they can be seen quickly and any problems identified.\n\"This can be solved within hours in some cases but 1% will have a serious disease and this can be detected,\" said Prof Olesen.\n\"For these patients before - they might have had to wait four to six months, so for the small percentage where something is found, they'd start treatment six months behind the time schedule.\"\nThe results so far\nProf Olesen - a former GP himself - said the changes have not led to a \"flooding of the system\" by more GP referrals but better organisation of how patients are diagnosed within existing resources.\nImportantly, he says it has also led to better survival rates.\n\"We've got very optimistic results showing Norway, Sweden and Finland are becoming better year by year,\" he said. \"But very clearly in the data Denmark is becoming better, a faster pace than before and catching up and getting closer to where we should be.\"\nDenmark has a similar health system in how it is funded and organised to Wales.\nHe said there could be lessons shared between Wales and Denmark on how better organisation can help \"in catching up the elite in Europe\".\nDr Tom Crosby, medical director of the Wales Cancer Network, said he had been impressed with how the Danish health service had broken down the barriers between GPs and specialists to work better together.\nHe said: \"People are not just doing tests in isolation - they are working together to achieve a diagnosis.\"",

        "document": "That report was never written, but the murdered opposition politician's colleagues, led by his close associate Ilya Yashin, have since worked to finish it.\nMost of the Russian-language report, entitled Putin. War, is based on facts that have already appeared in Russian and foreign media since Crimea was annexed in March 2014 and conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine.\nBut its authors say putting the facts together and describing the human and economic cost of the conflict makes a very compelling case for accusing President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends.\nRussia has consistently denied accusations that it has sent regular troops and armour to help rebels in eastern Ukraine, arguing that any Russians serving there are \"volunteers\".\nBut Mr Yashin, who presented the report, said Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive to securing all major victories claimed by the pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\"All the separatists' key successes were secured by Russian army units,\" he said.\n\"The soldiers directly admit they were directed on to Ukraine territory, admit that they were brought there to take part in a war operation. There is no doubt they did not end up there by accident.\"\nThe dossier presents evidence of volunteer soldiers who admit that it was Russian generals, not separatists, who directed the main battles in eastern Ukraine.\nA Russian army veteran, described as helping to enlist volunteers, says they are not doing it for nothing: salaries can reach $2,000-3,000 (\u00c2\u00a31,250-1,900) a month.\nRussian spending on the conflict is calculated at 53bn roubles (\u00c2\u00a3665m; $1bn):\nBoris Nemtsov began work on the report early this year, after hearing that the relatives of dead Russian soldiers had not been given promised compensation.\nBut those relatives never went public and, after his assassination, have become even more scared.\nNames and numbers of military units are documented, along with photos of weaponry, although activists point out these are harder to verify without knowing where they were taken.\nHow many Russians are fighting in Ukraine?\nBBC team attacked while investigating soldiers' deaths\nRussian families look for soldier sons\nMr Yashin said the opposition would seek donations to extend the initial print run of only 2,000 copies.\nBut publishing and distributing this kind of dossier is hard work. Many publishers were afraid to work with this material, he said.\nAnd above all, the question remains: How many people are keen to learn the facts which for months have been available on the internet and the few liberal media that remain in Russia?\nThere are plenty of Russians aware of their country's involvement in eastern Ukraine, who nevertheless find it acceptable, because they believe Moscow is supporting those who wish to be independent of the government in Kiev.\nBut the opposition does not see it as support. It accuses President Putin of masterminding and directing the war to boost his failing popularity.\nIn this, they admit he was successful.\nAnd it is entirely possible their report may well see the same fate as earlier works published by the late Boris Nemtsov.\nCritics of Mr Putin praised Mr Nemtsov's reports on corruption in the president's entourage and on the true cost of the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\nBut they failed to galvanise protests against him.",

(He has that in common with most of Mrs May's cabinet).\nThe first minister told AMs: \"I discussed the Article 50 letter in general terms with the prime minister when we met in Swansea last week.\n\"I should be clear, though, that I didn't see the letter before today and we were not invited to contribute to its drafting. This is unacceptable and is the culmination of a deeply frustrating process in which the devolved administrations have persistently been treated with a lack of respect.\n\"It is all the more regrettable given the UK government's stated aim was to develop a negotiating framework for the whole of the UK.\"\nMr Jones may have been playing to an audience, but Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns hit back: \"I'm a bit disappointed in that. The prime minister has been in Wales three times in the last six weeks.\n\"We've been talking about the contents of this letter for many months.\n\"We've clearly all made our representations but, ultimately, the UK government needs to act in the interests of the whole of the UK and that's what we're doing, specifically with Wales being mentioned.\"\nMrs May did indeed mention Wales in the letter. She told Donald Tusk: \"When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\"But it is the expectation of the government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration.\"\nThat sentence may have been written more with Scotland in mind, but it does prompt the question: which powers? Farming? Economic aid? And will the money follow the powers?\nAlun Cairns wouldn't answer those questions, although Carwyn Jones has said he fears there won't be any money to accompany the powers after 2020. (Perhaps Mr Jones doesn't think Jeremy Corbyn will win power that year - Labour has pledged to maintain EU funding levels on regional aid beyond 2020).\nSome in Whitehall think the way EU money has been spent in Wales - check out Nick Clegg's film from Ebbw Vale - is an argument for transferring those powers to Westminster, but that looks politically less likely now.\nWe may get some more details about the process in a white paper on the Great Repeal Bill on Thursday but, at the moment, the identity of the powers the UK government wants to see devolved is something of a mystery.",

        "document": "Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change.\n\u201cHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?\u201d shouted a producer in London. \u201cIf not, why not?\u201d\nThis appeared to be an impossible demand.\nSteve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle.\nThen I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.",

Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State.\nBut why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition?\nWell it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country.\nSurely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year.\nPresumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA (\"there is no alternative\").\nWhat is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity.\nWorse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend.\nNot that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me).\nThere is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people.\nSo for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead.\nMany would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half.\nSo if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.",

Getting people who lead chaotic lives - many of them with drink or drug problems - to work on time is a task in itself.\nIf sanctions are applied, they will end up in prison; if not, the sentence cannot be enforced. As the inspection report reveals, it is a problem the authorities still have not solved.\nInspectors did praise instances of high-quality work, and cases where offenders believed they had gained skills from using good tools and equipment.\nThey also highlighted that many offenders viewed their sentence positively and \"were determined to... desist from future offending\".\nAmong its recommendations were that community rehabilitation companies should reduce how often offenders are turned away from work when they have reported on time, and to try to create objectives for unpaid work that \"match the circumstances of the offender\".\nThe chief inspector of probation, Paul Wilson, said it appeared in most cases that unpaid work was viewed simply as a punishment, which was a \"wasted opportunity\".\n\"Although we found some high-quality management and delivery, much of it was simply not good enough, lacking in focus on the basic requirement to deliver and enforce the sentence of the court.\"\nHe called for \"urgent remedial action\".\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it wanted \"much more effective rehabilitation\" - which had to start with making sure offenders turned up on time and faced consequences if they did not.\n\"It's totally unacceptable for offenders to skip work enforced by the courts.\n\"We accept all the recommendations for the Ministry of Justice in this report and are already taking action to implement them.\"",

        "document": "The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community.\nDr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. \"Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,\" he was once quoted as saying.\nAnd he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.\nBut his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.\nAfter the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.\nScientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.\nBorn in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.\nAs an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.\nThis inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.\n\"Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,\" he said.\nDuring his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.\nBut the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.\nThen came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.\nHe switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.\nHis success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work \"any monkey\" could do.\nThe criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.\nAnd, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.\nHis greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.\nBoth efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.\nNevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.\nIn 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.\nBut he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.\nThe project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.\nThe synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.\n\"I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,\" he said of the synthetic microbes.\n\"If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.\"",

        "document": "In the late 1960s/early 1970s, the ice fields slipping down Mont Blanc and the surrounding mountains of the European range covered some 375 sq km.\nBy the late 2000s, this area had fallen to about 275 sq km.\nThe research has been presented at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists.\nIt mirrors some findings of retreat occurring in other sectors of the Alps which sit across the borders of several nations, but predominantly Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Germany, France, and Italy.\nThe new French Alps glaciers inventory was produced by Marie Gardent, from the University of Savoie, and colleagues.\nIt assessed the roughly 600 glaciers in broad areas incorporating the Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye and Grande Rousse Arves massifs, as well as the famous Mont Blanc Massif in the north.\nThe team drew upon map archives, past satellite imagery and aerial photographs.  Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct.\n\"We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier,\" explained Ms Gardent.\n\"Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there.  Also, deep shadows can hide the glacier margins.\"\nThe only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory. It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km.\nBy 1985-86, in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s/early 80s, glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km, the new survey shows.\nSince then, the withdrawal has accelerated, with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s.\nThis represents an average loss of some 26% over the last 40 years. The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps, however.  The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors.  In the Belledonne Massif, for example, glaciers have almost completely disappeared; and in the Ecrins Massif, glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif.\n\"The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps,\" Ms Gardent emphasised.\n\"We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south, but also because of climatic conditions which are different.  There is more precipitation in the north and there is also more cloud.\"\nThe northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La Mer de Glace, which falls over a 1,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself.  Its area today is just over 30 sq km, a shade smaller than the 31.5 sq km in the late 1960s/early 1970s.\nEfforts to assess and monitor glacier health are going on across the Alpine region.\nAt this very meeting three years ago, Swiss researchers reported that glaciers on their part of the European range were also losing mass at an accelerating rate.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk",

        "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break.\nHamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time.\nLobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack.\nBefore the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't.\nThe wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline.\nThe floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin.\nMerab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nGeorgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell.\nThe breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw.\nThe fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality.\nGeorgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though.\nAli Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth.\nScotland head coach Vern Cotter: \"It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points.\n\"In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball.\n\"But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to.\n\"I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him.

Adversity sometimes brings out the best in people, although nerves did seem to take effect after half-time.\nForan has said for some time his side just needed one win to get going. They have it and look capable of more as the pressure turns, at least temporarily, to sides above.\nTansey, who has agreed a pre-contract to join Aberdeen, was at the heart of the Saturday lunchtime victory. It was his delivery that found McKay ghosting in and the defender's finish was perfect.\nAnother Tansey delivery was rewarded when Donati wrestled Draper to the ground. Tansey took the responsibility and delivered under pressure.\nIn truth, Inverness could have been out of sight by the break.\nBilly Mckay should have done better from close range twice and Alex Fisher somehow screwed a header wide from a few yards after Remi Matthews had parried Tansey's drive.\nAnd, in the second period, Scott Boden could have sealed the win when clean through but dinked over.\nMartin Canning's side improved significantly after the break as Crawford and Redmond were sent on in place of Donati and Rakish Bingham.\nAnd Crawford thought he had earned a lifeline. As Gary Warren tried to shepherd the ball out, Esson came flying out and inexplicably took the substitute down.\nReferee Andrew Dallas did not point to the spot, leaving Hamilton players in disbelief. It was a huge escape for the home side.\nHaving offered little earlier in the match, other than a great chance for Darian MacKinnon which he prodded wide, the second-half response was firm.\nDougie Imrie, Crawford and Greg Docherty all came close but ultimately they did not threaten enough and gave themselves too much to do after leaving themselves repeatedly exposed in defence.\nRedmond's late finish was little consolation, although the goal may yet have an important part to play in the final make-up of goal difference with so few points separating the sides.\nMatch ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.\nSecond Half ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.\nGoal!

        "document": "You might forgive Laura Trott and Jason Kenny for leaving Rio rather full of themselves. Five competitions between them, five golds won. As of Tuesday night, had the couple been a country they would have sat 13th on the medal table, above Jamaica, Kenya and Brazil.\nThat would be to misunderstand what makes them tick. This is a couple who got engaged while on the sofa watching an episode of EastEnders.\nYou might think too that it would get competitive around the breakfast table in the cottage they share just outside Knutsford in Cheshire. Kenny now has six Olympic golds from three Games, more than Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Bradley Wiggins. Trott has four, more than any other British woman, and from one fewer Olympics.\nThat would be to misjudge their relationship. Cycling superstars on their own, together they can be almost ordinary, almost invisible. After the gold rush, after their tearful embrace in the Rio velodrome with the world watching on, that may be about to change.\n\"The difference in their characters is what makes it work for them,\" says Trott's father Adrian.\n\"Until he gets to know you, Jason is a little bit shy. He's quiet and understated. Laura is bubbly, chatty, just as you see in her interviews.\n\"If they were both like Jason, God only knows how they'd talk about anything. And God forbid having two Lauras in a household!\"\nThe relationship between the two began in the build-up to London 2012, with Kenny about to come out of Chris Hoy's muscled shadow at his second Olympics and Trott about to experience her first.\n\"I remember seeing Laura at the velodrome years ago,\" says Kenny's mother Lorraine.\n\"I said to my husband, 'Flipping heck, you need to watch this young lady.' She was in the elimination race, only a tiny thing, and she kept sprinting over the top of everyone. She was amazing.\n\"The first time I knew something was happening between the two of them was when Jason phoned me up and said, 'I'm bringing Trotty home for a bacon butty.'\n\"I said to him, 'Is she your girlfriend?' 'No, she's just a friend.'\n\"She made herself at home straight away. Into the house, sat down, feet up on the sofa.\n\"We liked her from the off. She's a girly girl, so I can talk make-up and clothes to her. It's such a treat - having had two sons, I've had years of remote-control cars and standing out in the rain, and at last I can talk to someone about posh shoes.\"\nTrott and Kenny are not the first couple to both win Olympic golds.\nSome (Steffi Graf, ladies' singles 1988, Andre Agassi, men's singles 1996) have carried more global renown. Others have also won gold in the same sport at the same Games, most recently triathletes Jan Frodeno and Emma Snowsill at Beijing in 2008. But no-one at a summer Games has more. No-one else gets even close.\nNeither has the British duo finished. Trott is 24, Kenny 28. The next Olympics in Tokyo are in their sights.\n\"When I first met Laura, what stuck in my mind was how she was on what she wanted to achieve,\" says her agent Luke Lloyd Davies.\n\"She said to me, 'I want to be the most decorated British Olympian of all time'. I remember thinking, for a 21-year-old to have that determination is remarkable.\n\"She reminds me of [former England rugby union player] Jonny Wilkinson - that same dedication, the way nothing will faze her in competition. Off the bike she is a really sweet 20-something. She likes getting dressed up, she dreams of Mulberry bags and Prada shoes. But when her peers are out partying, she is burying herself in training.\"\nAnd there is nothing glamorous about the sessions each put in at the velodrome at Manchester's Sportcity each day. Lap after 250m lap, staring at the black line and scuffed boards, round and round, lactic in the legs, fire in the lungs.\n\"It hurts so badly,\" Trott once told me. \"It's like your legs are getting squeezed. You try to fight against it, but it's horrible, and they're just getting tighter and tighter. You're going slower and slower.\"\nNothing has come easy. Born six weeks premature with a collapsed lung, Trott spent the first weeks of her life in intensive care. As a child she suffered serious asthma; at the exact moment she first sat on a bike, aged four, her big sister Emma - who would go on to race professionally for the Dutch team Dolmans-Boels - was crashing and breaking her leg at the bottom of the same hill.\nAs a young girl she preferred trampolining to her bike, only to be forced to give it up after repeatedly passing out in mid-air. \"I kept getting dehydrated during sessions, because you had to go out of the room to get a drink, and I was like, 'Nah, I'll carry on bouncing'.\"\nThat's the heroic stuff. Not everything she does ends in such glorious success,\n\"Laura is the sort of person who can ruin a baked potato in a microwave,\" says Adrian.\n\"We've always cooked with gas at home, but when she first moved into the British Cycling academy flats in Manchester, they had electricity instead. She put a potato in the oven to bake and thought she'd turned the gas on - except she'd put the grill on instead. Pretty soon it was on fire. She smoked the whole flat out.\"\nSo it is that Kenny tends to be entrusted with kitchen duties.\n\"He is a very good cook,\" says Lorraine. \"He now does a brilliant Sunday roast, although he never used to cook when he lived at home. He says Laura is the bad influence, that she's the one who buys the chocolate.\n\"He gets his sporting genes from me. I used to run 100m and 200m. His dad Michael is very self-disciplined, and Jason has inherited that from him.\n\"Unlike me, he copes well under pressure. I have to force myself to watch him in big finals. I used to put my hands over my eyes, but then he lost a race when I was doing that so I've had to go back to actually looking.\n\"When they were younger, we took both our boys to different sports - they were lively lads, so we were trying to keep them out of mischief. We were just an ordinary family, and he was an ordinary boy doing ordinary things.\n\"He's not changed at all. He's just Jason. His elder brother Craig is the chatterbox, so maybe Jason thought he never needed to talk. But he has a fantastic sense of humour. It's so dry I think sometimes people don't get it.\"\nFind out how to get into cycling with our special guide.\nWhen they return to the UK, Trott and Kenny will wind down by walking their two dogs, springer-poodle crosses named Pringle and Sprolo. In September they will get married. Already they have turned down an offer to have it featured in a magazine.\nFame has never been the driving force. Kenny may have 54,000 followers on Twitter, but he last tweeted in early July. Trott may have won more Olympic gold medals than any other British woman, but the motivation remains pure.\n\"It isn't a job to me, but if it did feel like one, it would be a dream job,\" she says. \"All I do is ride my bike for four hours a day and then lie on the sofa for the rest of it. I don't feel like I'd ever fall out of love with it.\"\nAnd each understands exactly what the other is going through. How could they not, when together they have turned a cottage in Cheshire into a medal factory?\n\"If I was in a relationship with someone outside cycling,\" says Trott, \"just imagine how hard it would be. I'd have to explain everything from scratch.\"\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",

        "document": "A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the system.\nIt said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers.\nThe commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year.\nProf Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world.\nHe found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets.\nBut it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection.\nSome felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income.\nProf Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer.\nBut he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.\nHe said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.\n\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\n\"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\"\nThe commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.\nA Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".\nHe added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.\n\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"",

She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV.\"\nThe prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the \"professionalism and bravery\" of the emergency services.\nShe pledged that the government \"stands ready to provide every assistance\" to the council and emergency services.\n\"I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re-housed in London and as close as possible to home.\"\nShe has ordered a judge-led public inquiry into the disaster. Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected.\nBut MPs demanded answers in a specially-arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday, while Parliament is still suspended.\nAt the start of the special meeting in Westminster's Grand Committee Room, Fire Minister Nick Hurd said: \"What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy.\"\nHe said the \"exceptionally complex\" investigation would take several months, and there would be no room for \"plodding bureaucracy\" in the official response.\n\"It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned,\" he said.\nAnswers were needed about fire walls, sprinkler systems, the alarm system and how the fire spread, he said.\n\"Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened, will be traumatised and will be very, very worried.\"\nShadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprinkler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry.\nThe new housing minister, Alok Sharma, said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety.\nThe government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly, he said.\nAt the end of the meeting, he promised \"every single family\" would be re-housed in the local area.\nEarlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, \"to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated\".\nLabour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately.\nRecommendations made after a fire in a tower block in Lakanal House in Camberwell in which six people died included installing sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations.\nIn October the former Housing Minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had \"publicly committed\" to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lakanal House fire.\nMr Healey said this review had \"not been started\".\n\"The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building,\" he said.\nResponding to reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was \"simply not true\" that a report about building regulations had been \"sat on\".\nThe BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry.\nHe or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness.\nThe Liberal Democrats have called for an urgent review into fire safety and building regulations.",

For every 81 minutes of election coverage he'd get 10 seconds and Bernie supporters know that.\"\n\"But people who get their election news from the mainstream media, they have no idea what Bernie is all about.

Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy. \"You can't make someone do something through diplomacy that they're not prepared to negotiate,\" he told me.\nCritics in Washington, though, have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force, giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith.\nSome have faulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia's willingness for a deal - \"delusional diplomacy\", the Washington Post called it.\nMr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal. But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the waning weeks of this administration, and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one.\nSyrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city.\nA statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria, part of Russia's ministry of defence, said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo.\nThe rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03:00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed.\nAs operations began, an ambulance service official in eastern Aleppo said that one convoy of ambulances had been shot at, with three people injured.\nThe White Helmets civil defence group tweeted that one senior volunteer had been shot and injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route for ambulances.\nBuses and ambulances are taking the injured, civilians and rebel fighters to the neighbouring province of Idlib, most of which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.\nThe buses left Aleppo via the road through the government-controlled south-western district of Ramousseh, heading towards the nearby rebel-held towns of Khan Touman and Khan al-Asal.\nThe chief of the Russian military's General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, told a news briefing: \"A humanitarian corridor has been created for the evacuation of militants.\"\n\"This corridor is 21km long,\" he said, adding, \"6km lie across Aleppo's territories controlled by government troops and another 15km through territories in the hands of illegal armed groups.\"\nTurkey, which helped to broker the evacuation, is preparing to receive some of the most vulnerable civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.\nIn a televised address, he said Turkey would take \"children, elders, those who are really in difficult conditions\".\nThe head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, told reporters that the wounded would be the first to be transferred.\nUN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said about 50,000 people were still trapped and he warned that moving those evacuated to Idlib might not prove much safer.\n\"If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire, Idlib will become the next Aleppo,\" he told reporters in Paris.\nThe 50,000 are said to include about 4,000 fighters and about 10,000 of their family members.\nAleppo's besieged residents have faced weeks of bombardment and chronic food and fuel shortages.\nRussian Lt Gen Viktor Poznikhir said on Thursday that, with the evacuation, the Syrian armed forces had almost finished their operations in Aleppo. Fighting has raged there for four years.\nIn October, President Assad said victory in Aleppo would be \"the springboard... to liberate other areas from terrorists\", a term the government uses to describe all rebel fighters.\nHe singled out Idlib province, west of Aleppo, that is almost entirely controlled by an alliance of Islamist rebel factions and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front.\nIdlib contains border crossings used by rebels to receive supplies from Turkey, a key backer. It also borders the coastal province of Latakia, the heartland of Mr Assad's minority Alawite sect.",

They said: 'We'd like you to work with this dialogue coach.'\n\"He said: 'You think we're all born the same?' I said: 'Of course we are.' He said: 'Some people are lucky, they're born 6ft 4ins and some people are born 3ft 2ins. Some people have got straight even features and some are not so pleasant on the eye.'\n\"I said: 'That's the luck of the draw, isn't it?'. He said: 'Yes, but the big sin is if you don't use what you've got'. He said: 'You're 6ft 1ins and you only stand 5ft 9ins, so if you believe we're all born the same way then why don't you stand your full height?\"\n\"He said did you go to university? I said: 'No'. He said: 'Do you regret that?' I said: 'Yes, I do a great deal'.\n\"He said: Do you feel that sometimes when you're talking with people that you might mispronounce a word or you don't have the right word for the explanation?' I said: 'Yes'.\n\"He said: 'Well, there you are. That's you're problem'.\nAnd it made such a difference to my life. Joe was on the set everyday. He made a lot of difference to me, gave me a great deal of confidence, otherwise I wouldn't be able to talk to you.\"\nThere will also be a showing at the Elan Valley Visitor Centre, near Rhayader, on 6 July.\n\"It's great that so many people have become involved in this project and I can't wait to see the effect their brilliant stories have on an audience,\" added Tally Evans.\n\"There's a huge range of stories, about 100 in total, ranging from a printing press falling down a lift shaft to a eulogy for a dead friend.\"\nSir Roger, who is not shown on screen but has a speaking part in Turning Points, is joined by Welsh athlete Jamie Baulch, an Olympic silver medallist in 1996.\nOthers taking part are artist Ellen Jackman, who lives in Birmingham, visually impaired dancer Lyn Street, from Newport, Daniel Chapman, an 11-year-old from near Rhayader who has autism, and the filmmaker himself, who is partially sighted.\nTally Evans said the stories were woven together to speak with one voice, while 11-year-old Morgan Evans, from Rhayader, runs through a Welsh landscape.\nVibrant images, sometimes lyrical, sometimes satirical, add depth and colour to the stories as they reach an inspiring conclusion.\nThere are other stories on the Turning Points website from Paralympic gold medallists Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson and David Roberts, world champion hurdler Dai Greene, former Commonwealth and European welterweight boxing champion Colin Jones and Olympic cycling gold medallist Geraint Thomas.\nIn the film Tally Evans explains how he came to terms with an hereditary eye problem, which left him partially sighted.\nA social worker told him his life was going to be different, and if he did not come to terms with it he would be a \"very unhappy man\".\n\"I refused rehab, where I was supposed to go off to another city to be taught how to be a proper, grateful disabled person, threw the Braille card in the bin and have lived exactly the sort of life I always wanted,\" Tally Evans said.\n\"I never saw my social worker again.\"\nThe film also has contributions from the former First Minister Rhodri Morgan and ex-Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart.\nNick Capaldi, Arts Council of Wales chief executive, said: \"Chris Tally Evans brings his own unique insight to a series of personal tales, set against the inspiring Welsh landscape.\"",

The federation would no doubt toast Mrs May if she abandoned the whole idea.\nThe home secretary told rank-and-file officers the murder of a police officer was \"a particularly appalling crime\".\n\"We ask police officers to keep us safe by confronting and stopping violent criminals for us,\" she said.\n\"And sometimes you are targeted by criminals because of what you represent.\"\nShe added: \"We are clear - life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer.\"\nThe Criminal Justice Act 2003 permits Justice Secretary Chris Grayling - following consultation with the Sentencing Council - to make an order to change starting points for sentences.\nIn this instance, it enables him to change the starting point from 30 years to a whole life order, meaning offenders could not be released other than at the discretion of the secretary of state on compassionate grounds - for example, if they are terminally ill or seriously incapacitated.\nThe Sentencing Council, the official body that oversees sentencing in England and Wales, issues guidelines for judges and magistrates to work to for all offences other than murder.\nA spokesman said: \"Introducing whole life tariffs for those who murder police officers would involve changes to the law, which is a matter for Parliament, rather than the Sentencing Council.\"\nBut he confirmed that the government had a duty to consult with the council before new legislation could be brought in.\nThe Sentencing Council says that, as things stand, whole life orders can be imposed in murder cases \"if the court decides that the offence is so serious that the offender should spend the rest of their life in prison\".\nThere are currently 47 prisoners in England and Wales who have been given whole life tariffs, including Rosemary West and \"Yorkshire Ripper\" Peter Sutcliffe.\nThe home secretary, who faced a question and answer session after her speech, was heckled at last year's conference after she told officers to \"stop pretending\" they were being singled out and would \"have to make their share\" of public spending cuts.\nPolice Federation chairman Steve Williams, who had earlier welcomed Mrs May's sentencing plan, told her morale was low as a result of the government's programme of cuts and reforms.\nSpeaking at the conference, he urged the home secretary not to \"hang your reforms on the reprehensible behaviour of a handful of officers\".\nThe biggest applause came when he called for the government to abandon plans for compulsory severance, which are currently subject to negotiation.\nChief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor, who is behind hotly debated changes such as fast-track recruitment and lower annual pay for new constables, was also due to address officers.\nOn Tuesday, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the three-day conference that government plans to withdraw from the European Arrest Warrant agreement would make it harder to catch criminals who went on the run abroad.",

Otherwise you have a ban for Chernova that really looks quite ineffective.\"\nChernova's backdated ban is due to expire on 21 June, and with the qualification period for the 2015 World Championships in Beijing running until 10 August, she could compete both there and at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\"It would be frustrating if she lines up on the starting line but those are the rules out there and we need to abide by them,\" said Minichiello.\n\"That is why we think Wada needs to look at its code and penalties to show there is potentially a loophole that needs to be looked. I'm sure the Russian anti-doping agency have administered suspensions according to the rules, so therefore it needs to be looked at.\"\nLast week, Russia's athletics head coach Valentin Maslakov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences.\nWada is investigating allegations of widespread doping and corruption in Russian athletics after claims were aired in a recent German television documentary, with a report due to be published by the end of the year.\nThe IAAF said last week it was concerned about the number of Russian doping cases in the sport.",

And late last year, it bought the four-year-old MinecraftEdu version of the game from Finland-based independent developer TeacherGaming.\nIt is now promising to add features, but schools may face extra costs.\nIt says more than 7,000 classrooms around the world already use Minecraft in some form.\n\"Teachers are using Minecraft to do so many things, including teaching maths, science, religion and poetry,\" Anthony Salcito, Microsoft's vice-president of worldwide education, told the BBC.\n\"Once we make the tools easier for schools to get access to and employ, I think you'll see that number [of classrooms] grow quite quickly.\"\nMinecraftEdu already allows teachers to modify content in the game and use a shared library of education-themed assets.\nMicrosoft is promising to improve the experience by:\nTo access the service, children and teachers each need their own Office 365 ID, which can also be used to provide access to the Microsoft's cloud-based productivity software.\nMicrosoft says this will help teachers minimise the number of online accounts they need to manage.\nBut it may also help the company promote its word processing, email, and file-sharing apps over rival services from Google and others.\nMicrosoft intends to charge an annual fee of $5 (\u00c2\u00a33.50) for each teacher and child.\nThat could prove more expensive than the current basic set-up, where schools pay a one-off fee of $14 multiplied by the maximum number of people they want to be able to log in at once, plus an additional $41 for server software.\n\"We believe we are bringing added value,\" said Deirdre Quarnstrom, director of Minecraft education.\n\"On top of having a persistent identity, they will also have access to the most current version of the game.\n\"MinecraftEdu, along with other Minecraft mods, was one to two releases behind by nature of the development process.\n\"We are also replacing the need for schools to have and maintain separate server hardware.\"\nThe new features were welcomed by Leigh Wolmarans, the head teacher of Lings Primary School in Northampton.\nHis school already uses MinecraftEdu to teach pupils about A Midsummer Night's Dream by asking them to create a performance of Shakespeare's play within the game.\nHowever, he said other teachers should be aware the software had its limitations.\n\"Technology can lead to exceptional learning, but it has to be used in conjunction with other tools,\" he said.\n\"If all you are doing is sitting them down and leaving them to experience Shakespeare through Minecraft, you would be doing something wrong.\n\"Dance, art, drama and music remain the best ways to teach kids.\n\"But technology can add to that as an additional tool.\"\nMicrosoft said it would allow teachers to start \"beta-testing\" Minecraft's education edition at some point \"in the summer\" without charge, ahead of its formal rollout.",

        "document": "Younger people take religion seriously \"when they have the chance to learn about it,\" he said.\nAnd Cardinal Keith O'Brien, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, urged Christians to wear a cross to symbolise their beliefs.\nIt comes amid a growing debate about secularisation in British society.\nMeanwhile, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have attended traditional Easter Sunday service at Windsor Castle.\nDuring the service at Canterbury Cathedral, Dr Williams said it was the wrong time to \"downgrade the status and professional excellence\" of religious education in schools.\nRE is not one of the subjects counting towards the English Baccalaureate, the standard for ranking schools brought in by the coalition government.\nThe English Baccalaureate ranks secondary schools in England according to the number of pupils who get good GCSEs in English, maths, science, another language and a humanities subject - either geography or history.\nSupporters of religious education want to see it included in the humanities category.\nBy Robert PigottReligious affairs correspondent, BBC News\nDuring his decade as leader of the Church of England, Dr Williams has repeatedly complained that Christianity is being marginalised in British public life.\nToday he welcomed what he said was a reduction in active hostility towards religion, but issued a new warning.\nIt was that \"serious and liberal-minded commentators\" were embracing religion as a socially useful tool - for example for rethinking our \"destructive economic habits\" - but wanted to \"pick out the best bits of religion without all the embarrassing beliefs that go with it\".\nThe archbishop insisted that it was precisely those awkward beliefs - such as the actual resurrection of Jesus - that mattered in Christianity, and that without them it would cease to make sense.\nHis fear is that Christianity might survive the active hostility of atheists, only to succumb to a kind of asset stripping which reduced it to a set of well-meaning principles without really saying anything about God.\nBut the government says it is already a compulsory National Curriculum subject and the English Baccalaureate is to encourage more students to take up geography and history in addition to RE - not instead of it.\nIn his sermon, Dr Williams said: \"There is plenty to suggest that younger people, while still statistically deeply unlikely to be churchgoers, don't have the hostility to faith that one might expect, but at least share some... sense that there is something here to take seriously - when they have a chance to learn about it.\n\"It is about the worst possible moment to downgrade the status and professional excellence of religious education in secondary schools.\"\nDr Williams said a hostility towards faith and religion in public life may have been tempered by a recent appreciation of the social value of religion.\nBut he said the ultimate test of Christianity was not whether it was beneficial to the human race, but whether the resurrection of Jesus Christ actually happened.\nHe said that for Christians a vision of reconciled love between people \"is there only because God raised Jesus\" and that the answer was not in scientific proof, but by the way believers lived with and in their faith.\nThe latest debate on faith in Britain was ignited after Conservative co-chairwoman Baroness Warsi warned that the nation was under threat from a rising tide of \"militant secularisation\".\nThe Muslim peer said in February that Europe needed to become \"more confident and more comfortable in its Christianity\".\nResearch carried out in the same month by a secularist foundation suggested three-quarters of people who describe themselves as Christian in Britain displayed only a low level of belief and practice of the religion.\nThe Ipsos Mori poll, for the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, was rubbished by the Church, with Reverend Giles Fraser, former Canon Chancellor of St Paul's, saying it was not fair to trump people's \"self-identification\" as Christians.\nIn his Easter Sunday sermon, Cardinal O'Brien told worshippers to \"wear proudly a symbol of the cross of Christ\" each day of their lives.\nHe also voiced concern at the growing \"marginalisation\" of religion.\nDr Williams also issued a call for peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East.\nHe said: \"A visit to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem, will convince you why the state of Israel exists and must go on existing.\n\"A visit to any border checkpoint will convince you that the daily harassment and humiliation of Palestinians of all ages and backgrounds cannot be a justifiable or even sustainable price to pay for security.\"\nHe said: \"We have to prod and nag and encourage the religious leadership in the Holy Land on all sides to speak as if they believed in a God who acts, not only a God who endorses their version of reality.\n\"We have to pray, to pray for wisdom and strength and endurance for all who are hungry for peace and justice, pray that people will go on looking for a truly shared future.\"\nIn March, Dr Williams announced he would step down as Archbishop of Canterbury - the head of the Church of England - in December, after 10 years in the role.",

Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box.\nWhen skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead.\nInjuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence.\nSt Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals.\nIt was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal.\nOverall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves.\nThere was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead.\nThey might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away.\nSt Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick.\nSwanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory.\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems.\n\"Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well.\n\"Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet.\"\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season.\n\"You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clich\u00e9s, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today.\n\"I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games.\n\"But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

I have an apple. Apple-pen!\nI have a pen. I have [a] pineapple. Pineapple-pen!\nApple-pen. Pineapple-pen. Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen.\"\nBut how did the 40-year-old DJ come up with such a bizarre song about fusing a pen with an apple and a pineapple?\n\"When I was making this music with play, I was [just] singing it too soon,\" the newly-crowned internet star explained in a tweet to fans from an account created for his newly-coined character.\nIt has all the ingredients for a viral video formula: an addictive beat, silly lyrics and a hilariously simple dance routine to back it up.\nAnd it was only a matter of time before the minute-long song, first uploaded onto Piko-Taro's official YouTube channel, quickly spread to Facebook.\nWhile the original video has gone on to amass more than 4m views, entertainment portal 9GAG's Facebook video surpassed that to draw more than 44m views.\n\"I'm ruined - I will never get this song out of my head,\" lamented Facebook user Carlos Andr\u00c3\u00a9s Silva in a comment.\nNelson Rivera Adrian Paige agreed, voicing concern for the number of times he has looped the video. \"I am both highly amused as well as extremely confused.\"\nOther users like Daniel Hou who watched the video pointed out Piko-Taro's unique wardrobe.\n\"Am I the only one who noticed that this guy is the real-life version of Borsalino [Kizaru] from One Piece,\" he said, drawing reference to the popular flamboyantly-dressed manga-anime character.\nBut one man's catchy viral song may prove to be another's jarring burden.\n\"Please stop sharing this annoying song, it's exploded on my feed and is driving me up the wall because it's so irritating to listen to,\" said Facebook user Hiro Kenshida in a plea.\nAt time of writing, few mainstream Japanese news sites have covered this particular earworm, even though it has been widely picked up internationally. It has not particularly trended on Japanese social media.\nHe has already been dubbed the next Psy and it could even be that this was precisely what was in mind - one catchy  ditty, pushed by digital influencers but with the precise aim of becoming a global phenomenon.\nBut the hype did not stop there.\nHundreds of tributes and covers of Piko-Taro's tune have also appeared on Facebook, each gaining cult followings of their own.\nMany Japanese stars, including popular duo Riko and Rika, came up with vines of their own.\nThere's even been a heavy metal tribute as well as a cover from Thai social media star Happy Polla.\nWhat a time to be alive.",

        "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nA World Anti-Doping Agency commission report has accused Russia of running a \"state-sponsored\" doping programme.\nAnd Warner said he feels sports other than athletics have reason to be concerned at how Russian sport is run.\n\"This iceberg spreads in two different directions,\" he said. \"I suspect there are probably four, five or six nations that athletics has a problem with.\"\nCommission chairman Dick Pound said Russia's athletics federation, Araf, should be banned from the Rio 2016 Olympics.\nWarner told BBC Radio 5 live: \"Every other international sport today should be looking at Russian sport and looking at whether the men and women who compete in their events are clean.\"\n\"They do not have robust anti-doping regimes. They are asleep on the job - and they have to be rooted out.\"\nWada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, also implicated the International Association of Athletics' Federations.\nThe IAAF's former president Lamine Diack has been provisionally suspended by the International Olympic Committee, who have also asked the IAAF to start disciplinary action against the athletes named in the report.\nAraf has been told to respond to the report by Friday and Russia have defended their position.\nActing head of Russia Athletics Federation, Vadim Zelichenok, said: \"There is an element of a political hit job here because quite a few things were described in the report in a biased way.\"\nRussia's sports ministry has said it will work more closely with Wada,\nIgor Zagorskiy, deputy director of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, Rusada, told the BBC: \"There is always room for improvement.\n\"We are on that track and we've been on that track together with Wada. We will continue this work on this.\"\nWarner says the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), must be restructured to combat the problem.\nHe revealed that he had spoken to IAAF president Lord Coe since Monday's publication of Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, and also implicated the IAAF.\nThe 323-page report said that \"acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread\" in Russia and suggested that neither Araf, Rusada, nor the Russian Federation can be considered anti-doping code-compliant.\nThe report also said the London 2012 Olympics were \"sabotaged\" by \"widespread inaction\" against athletes with suspicious doping profiles; accuses Moscow laboratory director Grigory Rodchenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep; and recommends that five Russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPound, who chaired the Wada investigation, said the situation was \"worse than we thought\", adding that \"it may be a residue of the old Soviet Union system\".\nWarner backed the recommendation to suspend Russia from competition \"until they put their house in order\", adding: \"If you punish one or two innocent Russian athletes for the greater good of the sport, that is a moral dilemma I am willing to grasp.\"\nHe also suggested that Russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping, saying that \"athletics has probably got some other nations to root out\".\nHe added that while \"there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics\", he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the Western world.\nDuring a special BBC Radio 5 live programme examining the independent report, Britain's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe said: \"I don't think anyone is under the impression it's only Russia.\"\nOn the same programme, former British sprinter Darren Campbell warned of \"darker days to come\".\nHe said: \"This report was about Russia, and they need to be punished if this holds up, but we'll lose sight on the bigger issues if we focus on Russia. It's about cleaning everything out.\n\"There's people talking about testing out in Kenya and Jamaica. We can't have rumours anymore.\n\"We need to understand how the Russians got away with it. How did this happen yet nobody knew?\n\"No matter how dark and depressing it gets, change has to happen now.\"\nCoe, elected IAAF president in August, described the Wada report as \"alarming\" and has said he will seek urgent approval from members to consider sanctions against the Russian federation.\nThe report found evidence of multiple rules breaches by IAAF officials and found the governing body to be \"inexplicably lax in following up suspicious blood (and other) profiles\".\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt has also been criticised for its handling of the allegations, with Coe himself describing claims about suspicious blood profiles involving some athletes as \"a declaration of war on my sport\" in August.\nOn Monday, Coe said that \"if there are failings in our governance or our anti-doping programme I will fix them\".\nBut Warner says Coe needs to restructure the IAAF in order for it to effectively tackle the problem.\n\"This cannot be a one-man crusade,\" Warner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"He needs to ensure there is a bench around him at the IAAF who dramatically improve the operation.\n\"We all know, and he has already said, he needs to go out and hire a good chief executive.\n\"It needs more than that. He also possibly needs a chairman under him so he can take the lead of the elected council and be the ambassador for the sport and have full-time professional staff, possibly from outside sport, from elsewhere in business, who can get a grip on the organisation.\"",

        "document": "The hosts claimed Australia's last five wickets for 44 runs on Friday morning to bowl them out for 308 and secure a first-innings lead of 122.\nIan Bell and Joe Root both scored 60 and Ben Stokes 42 as England surged further ahead in the afternoon session to the delight of a buoyant Cardiff crowd.\nAnd although wickets fell regularly in a frenetic finale, Mark Wood's unbeaten 32 helped England reach 289 all out to set Australia an improbable 412 to win.\nOnly two teams in Test history have successfully chased that many runs, with Australia's best effort the 404-3 by Don Bradman's 'Invincibles' at Headingley in 1948.\nEngland set the tone for a near-perfect day with an electric performance on the third morning, executing their plans to perfection to finish off the Australia innings.\nShane Watson's vulnerability to lbws was brilliantly exploited as Stuart Broad dismissed him for 30 in the second over of the day before Wood pinned Nathan Lyon in front of his stumps.\nJames Anderson found swing with the new ball to induce edges from Brad Haddin and Mitchell Starc, with Broad removing Mitchell Johnson in between.\nIn little more than an hour, England had advanced from a position of relative strength to one of total control.\nAfter a nervy start with the bat - failures for Alastair Cook and Gary Ballance left England teetering on 22-2 - their second innings found momentum.\nAdam Lyth showed his mettle with a fluent 37, but the main catalyst was Bell, who put a dreadful sequence of 56 runs in nine innings behind him with a fine half-century.\nThe Warwickshire batsman went on the front foot from the off, lashing two cover drives in one Mitchell Starc over and peppering the third-man boundary with his trademark late cut.\nHe reached fifty off 75 balls, and underlined his new-found confidence by crashing Johnson over cover for his 11th four.\nThe next ball brought Bell's undoing however, as, clearly expecting the short ball, he backed away slightly and was clean bowled to give Johnson his first wicket of the match.\nBy the time of Bell's dismissal, England were flying and the in-form duo of Root and Stokes kept them airborne, with both finding the boundary nine times.\nA mini-collapse from 207-4 to 245-8 in the last session gave Australia a glimmer of hope, only for England to find inspiration from an unlikely source.\nSwinging from the hip, Wood took the lead role in a 43-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Moeen Ali and was still at the crease when Anderson became Lyon's fourth victim in the very last action of the day.\nEngland's brilliance has set up the possibility of a four-day finish, and the hosts would be wise to do their utmost to wrap things up on Saturday because of heavy showers forecast for Sunday.\nAustralia will no doubt still fancy their chances of pulling off a record-breaking victory, but in reality the Welsh weather represents their best chance of avoiding going into next week's second Test at Lord's 1-0 down.\nAustralia spinner Nathan Lyon: \"We're definitely still in it. If we bat two days the result will go our way. There's no reason why we can't dig deep.\n\"We've got to learn from our first innings with the bat - be more patient. There were too many 30s in the first innings, so we need to try and push on a bit more and have a couple of our top five get big hundreds.\"\nEngland batsman Ian Bell: \"There are no gimmes and we expect more tomorrow. We are going to have to work hard to win.\"",

        "document": "Ashya was being treated in hospital in Southampton when his parents took him abroad without telling staff last year.\nThey ignored medical advice and took him to Prague for proton beam therapy.\nIt was later revealed Ashya did not receive subsequent chemotherapy in Prague, a move the team in Southampton say could jeopardise his recovery.\nSpeaking exclusively to the BBC, Dr Peter Wilson, paediatric intensive care consultant at Southampton General Hospital, said: \"We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is... every month that goes by that he's not getting chemotherapy, his outcome worsens.\n\"There are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival - so survival going from 80% to 40% or 50%, which is quite dramatic.\"\nThe Kings' version of events last year sparked a public outcry and staff members in Southampton said they received angry emails, letters and phone calls which, at one stage, forced the hospital to shut its switchboard.\nThe King family, who in March said five-year-old Ashya was now cancer free, declined to be interviewed as part of the BBC programme.\nIn March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Brett King told a national newspaper a recent scan showed \"no evidence\" of the tumour.\nBut cancer experts have told the BBC although it appears Ashya is in remission it is far too early to say he has been completely cured.\nOncology specialist Professor Karol Sikora said: \"Ashya is not completely out of the woods yet, but 78% of children with this type of rare cancer actually survive and are cured.\n\"The fact he is disease free at this point is great, but it doesn't mean he is cured yet.\"\nThe breakdown in the relationship between Brett King and the hospital stemmed from his belief that Ashya should not receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy following surgery to remove a brain tumour.\nMr King claimed in a YouTube video that staff threatened him with a court order if he refused Ashya's treatment, something the hospital has denied.\nHe told journalists in Spain after his arrest: \"They were going to kill him in England or turn him into a vegetable.\"\nThrough the media, the King family raised tens of thousands of pounds for Ashya's treatment before the NHS agreed to pay for proton therapy in Prague.\nDr Nicky Thorp, of the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group of paediatricians, said: \"We were dismayed, but on reflection I can see why NHS England agreed to fund that child's case. The child was there, the child needed radiotherapy.\n\"The use of protons does not improve cure rates of tumours... and it saddens me to see the way the truth can be twisted and misunderstood.\"\nIn Prague, Ashya's parents refused the chemotherapy, which had been recommended by doctors and ordered by the High Court.\nBut in March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Mr King said his son was cancer free.\nPaediatric oncology consultant Dr Ramya Ramanujachar, who was involved in Ashya's treatment, warned the case could set a worrying precedent.\nShe said: \"I don't think the parents can look after their own child with a brain tumour and be not only the carers but also the professionals directing, managing and dictating their child's treatment.\"\nDr Wilson said the case had led to an \"impossible situation\" for clinicians faced with families in the same situation.\n\"That is deeply unfair when the NHS is always supposed to be about equal healthcare for all,\" he added.\nAshya: The Untold Story is to be broadcast on BBC1 in the South region on Friday at 19:30 BST.",

        "document": "It was scrapped this week at the eleventh hour when the government removed it from parliament moments before it was due to be voted into law.\nUnder the proposal, which had already passed a first round of voting, it would have been illegal to share information electronically that could \"destroy, alter or subvert state institutions\" or \"damage national integrity or independence\".\nThis would have meant anyone criticising the government on social networking sites such as Facebook, or receiving an email containing anti-government sentiment, could have faced up to 12 years in prison.\nThe law also wanted to ban the online sharing of videos, pictures or recordings without the subject's consent, criminalise \"whistle-blowing\" under the crime of \"espionage\" and make it illegal for anyone to search for information about the state, even if it was not classified.\nMinister of State Carlos Feijo told reporters in the capital, Luanda, that a decision had been made instead to insert special clauses about internet crimes into the new penal code currently under revision.\nBut many believe pressure from civil society and local journalists, who had strongly opposed the legislation claiming that it was \"totalitarian\" and violated basic freedom of expression, played a role in the decision to abandon the law.\nUS-based lobby group Human Rights Watch said the legislation would have \"undercut both freedom of expression and information, and posed a severe threat to independent media, whistle-blowers, and investigative journalism\".\nWith most of Angola's traditional media controlled by the state, or owned by government ministers and their business associates, there is little free debate in the newspapers or on television and radio.\nOpposition parties are rarely afforded column inches or air time, while government and presidential activities are covered in minute detail and nearly always with a positive spin.\nCivil society and opposition groups have therefore turned to the internet, even though only 1% of Angolans have access to the web, to hold their debates and share information through blogs and social networking sites.\nIn recent months, several anti-government marches have been organised and promoted through Facebook, where there are pages dedicated to opposing the president of nearly 32 years, Jose Eduardo dos Santos. There, people make comments they would not dare speak out loud in public.\nAngolans living in the diaspora have also been busy online, creating websites to rally support for regime change, and there have been several solidarity protest events held in South Africa, the UK and Belgium.\nMany are growing weary of the current regime and want more to be done to share the country's oil wealth among the majority, two thirds of whom still live in poverty and many without access to water or electricity.\nThe introduction of a special internet law was seen as a deliberate attempt to quash the online discussion that was fuelling this unrest.\nIn an uncharacteristically emotional speech last month, President dos Santos lashed out at social media sites, saying they were being used to \"insult, denigrate and provoke uproar and confusion\".\nOfficially the government stuck to its position that the technology legislation was needed to curb crimes such as child pornography, hacking and online financial fraud.\nThe editor of the private weekly newspaper Angolense, Suzana Mendes, who was among the journalists who publicly voiced concerns about the law, welcomed its withdrawal.\n\"The fact that the bill has been cancelled is important, because if it had been approved, it would have endangered our fundamental rights to inform and be informed,\" she told the BBC.\nSizaltina Cutaia, from the Angolan office of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (Osisa), which also opposed the bill, said they were pleased the government had backed down.\n\"This is definitely a victory for us and it is encouraging that we were able to get our message across.\" she said.\nHowever, civil society celebrations around the scrapping of the legislation were short-lived after a number of activists were arrested on Wednesday for taking part in an anti-poverty demonstration in Luanda.\nOrganised via Facebook by a group calling itself the Revolutionary Movement of Social Intervention (MRIS), the protest was due to take place at lunchtime.\nBut following the arrest of MRIS leader Luis Bernardo, allegedly detained while putting up posters near his home in the district of Cazenga, only a few dozen people gathered in the city square.\nAccording to reports, between 15 and 20 people were detained, among them a journalist and a representative from Osisa who had been trying to film the arrests.\nThey were later released and rejoined the protest, which at its height numbered around 100 people.\nA spokesman for Luanda's provincial government told state media that the youth involved, who claimed they had authorisation to stage the protest, had acted \"criminally\" and the police force was within its rights to respond.\n\"What the government needs to realise is that the more they repress people, the more they will want to demonstrate,\" Ms Cutaia said.\nAlthough small in size and number, protests like these are a relatively new phenomenon in Angola where few have dared to question the authority of President Dos Santos and his ruling MPLA.\n\"The people leading these protests are young and they don't have as much to lose. They were born after independence so they don't have that connection to the ruling party like older generations,\" Ms Cutaia says.\n\"All they see is that despite Angola's wealth under the MPLA most people have remained poor and they want that to change.\n\"Most of all they want the right to be able to make their voices heard.\"",

Twenty are in critical condition, according to Xinhua.\nSeparately, the UK's Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel they mishandled their stock market rescue efforts.\nThe paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of \"destabilising the market\".\nChinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours.\nThe rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said.\nThe news agency said \"seditious rumours about China's upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II\" were also among the offences.\nA journalist was also arrested along with several stock market officials, according to a Xinhua report. The journalist, Wang Xiaolu, is accused of \"spreading fake information\" about the market slump, the report said.\nThe state news agency said Mr Wang confessed that he \"wrote fake report on Chinese stock market based on hearsay and his own subjective guesses without conducting due verifications\".\nIn 2013 Chinese authorities introduced a possible three-year sentence for spreading rumours - the sentence was supposed to apply to anyone who posted a rumour that was reposted 500 times or viewed 5,000 times.\nLast year, Qin Zhihui, a blogger, was sentenced to three years in a government crackdown on internet rumours.

        "document": "On Thursday, an investment manager and hairdresser will challenge the right of the government to start the process of withdrawing the UK from the EU without a vote in Parliament.\nLawyers will question whether Prime Minister Theresa May is entitled to act unilaterally, using powers left over from the days of medieval monarchs.\nIt could end up - in theory - with Parliament being given a means to stop Brexit.\nSo as constitutional rows go, it is box office stuff.\nOr as professor of public law at Cambridge University, Mark Elliott, puts it: \"I don't rule out the possibility of the government losing the case.\"\nLeading the fight against the government is Gina Miller, who runs an investment firm in London, SCM Private.\nShe argues that only Parliament can make a decision that leads to the loss of her \"rights\" under EU law.\nShe is confident she has a strong case and is undaunted by criticism.\n\"I do not back away from a fight,\" she says. \"I'm very vocal about things and I'm no stranger to making enemies.\"\nShe is joined by London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.\nAlso weighing into the case against the government is the group, Fair Deal for Expats.\nAround two million British citizens are believed to live and work in other EU countries.\nThe Brexit terms have not been decided but expats - some of whom were barred from voting in the referendum - fear potential repatriation and are worried about the impact on their jobs and homes as well as the ramifications for healthcare, their children's schooling and pensions.\nThree London law firms - Mishcon de Reya, Edwin Coe and Bindmans - have agreed to take up the case. Croft Solicitors is representing the expats.\nSuperstar of the bar\" Lord Pannick QC - also an independent member of the House of Lords - will be arguing Gina Miller's case while the government is turning to an old favourite, James Eadie QC.\nAttorney General Jeremy Wright QC, the government's legal adviser, will also play a big role.\nHe said: \"There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to re-join it through the back door, and no second referendum.\n\"We do not believe this case has legal merit. The result should be respected and the government intends to do just that.\"\nIn political terms, the UK is on course for departure from the EU. But as far as the law goes, nothing has changed.\nThe UK remains a fully paid-up member of the EU until it triggers Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.\nThe question at the heart of the row is: who should activate Article 50? The prime minister or Parliament?\nDuring the referendum campaign, the then prime minister, David Cameron, said that in the event of a Leave vote he would activate Article 50 immediately. The government maintains that his successor Theresa May has the authority to do so, without a vote by MPs.\nThat right - they say - is based on the Royal Prerogative - powers once held by kings and queens to do, essentially, what they wished.\nThe use of prerogative powers in a modern parliamentary democracy is a curious corner of British law.\nOver centuries, power in the UK has been wrested away from dictatorial monarchs and handed to elected politicians.\nBut government ministers have managed to cling on to a few of those regal powers, usually in international affairs.\nOne such prerogative is the power to make and break treaties with other countries.\nThe government's position is that triggering Article 50 is all about ending a treaty with other EU countries and so using prerogative powers in these circumstances is \"entirely consistent with standard constitutional practice\".\nCritics will argue in the High Court that it is a bit more complicated than that.\nThey say that activating Article 50 effectively wipes out the European Communities Act 1972, passed by Parliament and allowing EU law to apply in the UK.\nLawyers opposing the government argue that the 1972 Act introduced a big constitutional change and gave British people new rights.\nIt would be unlawful, they conclude, for a prime minister to use the Royal Prerogative to take away rights bestowed by Parliament.\nGrahame Pigney, from the People's Challenge, says the \"enforced removal\" of citizenship rights from 65 million people would be \"completely unprecedented\" in a modern democracy.\n\"I believe that, as Parliament has granted us these rights, it is for Parliament to decide when, how and under what circumstances they are taken away,\" he says.\nLawyers working for Fair Deal for Expats will be deploying similar legal arguments but using evidence to emphasise the human impact of Brexit.\nThe chairman of Fair Deal for Expats, John Shaw - who lives in France - has submitted a statement to the High Court saying the referendum result was a \"shock\".\nHe is currently undergoing cancer treatment in France.\nHe states: \"If my right to access healthcare is either taken away, or compromised materially such that I am not able to rely upon it in the same way as French nationals, I would be unlikely to receive, or be able to afford, the same level of care in France.\"\nHis lawyers will tell the High Court that the rights enjoyed by British citizens \"beyond these shores\" are so fundamental that legislation is \"required\" to take them away.\nBut in legal papers setting out the government's case - released last week - it insists that starting the withdrawal process will not have any impact on British laws and any changes will be decided in future negotiations.\nThe Royal Prerogative is just one of the arguments to be aired in the High Court.\nThere will be heated debates about the 2015 European Union Referendum Act, which paved the way for a referendum.\nIn their legal papers the government states that Parliament passed that Act on the \"clear understanding\" that the outcome of the referendum would be \"respected\".\nIf Gina Miller wins the case - it adds - it will not be able to \"give effect to the will and decision of the people\".\nConservative chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, and prominent Leave campaigner Sir Bill Cash thinks the government has a strong case, saying: \"To attempt to revisit the decision by another Act of Parliament is a kind of fraud on the electorate.\"\nBut lawyers at Mishcon de Reya say the idea was to set up an \"advisory\" referendum - not a binding one.\nThey state: \"Nowhere in the 2015 Act does it specify the consequences that should follow from the referendum result.\"\nThe biggest weapon in the government's armoury could be that the whole issue is not a matter for the UK courts at all.\nThey says it is a complex decision that must be made by ministers.\nSir Bill Cash said: \"We could have a situation where judges are imposing a requirement on Parliament, via the secretary of state, to make legislation.\n\"That's outside the rules. The proceedings of parliament are outside the jurisdiction of the court.\"\nLord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, will hear the case - which is expected to last a couple of weeks.\nMark Elliott says it is very hard to know which way it will go.\n\"If the court simply applied existing case law, the government would win. The question is whether the court will go beyond existing territory and treat it as an exceptional situation. The court may develop the law.\"\nPutting the legal arguments aside, some Brexit supporters say that the High Court case is a fig-leaf for a political campaign to keep the UK inside the EU.\nGina Miller disputes that and argues that Leavers and Remainers should back her case against \"prerogative creep\".\n\"The idea that a court case can put a halt to Brexit is nonsense and it has nothing to do with altering the timetable. What we are looking for is legal certainty.\"\nIf the court concludes that Parliament must approve Article 50, that could be a game-changer.\nThe majority of MPs campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU. They could, in theory, vote against the activation of Article 50.\nBut would they risk enormous political and social ructions by rejecting the referendum result?\nMost members of the House of Lords are also opposed to Brexit. That raises the possibility of another extraordinary scenario - an unelected Lords voting against the wishes of 17.4 million people.\nIf the government loses its case in the British courts, they could eventually go to the European Court of Justice.\nIt raises the possibility of a truly strange scenario - Brexit ministers asking European judges to overturn the decision of the British courts.",

        "document": "As Ron Jones, from Newport, prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city's cathedral, he says that amongst all the terrible memories, there will also be a few which will make him smile.\nHe was captured in 1943 fighting in the Middle East, and after nine months in Italy, was transferred to forced labour camp E715, part of the Auschwitz complex.\nThere he spent 12 hours a day, six days a week, working with hazardous chemicals in the IG Farben works, but on Sundays they were permitted to play football.\n\"I think the Germans thought that letting us play football was a quick and easy way of keeping us quiet,\" he said.\n\"The Red Cross would bring us food parcels, and when they heard about our football, they managed to get us strips for four teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. I was always the Wales goalkeeper.\n\"It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence.\"\nHe says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from PoW camps during the final stages of the conflict.\nWhilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better.\n\"You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march.\"\nE715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops.\nWhilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe.\n\"In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz,\" he said.\n\"Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going.\n\"We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next.\"\nBut when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale.\n\"The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches,\" he said.\n\"We asked, 'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout 'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question.\n\"We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums.\n\"Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football.\n\"Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up.\"\nMr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau.\n\"You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us,\" he said.\n\"Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes.\n\"But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared. 'We didn't need to know', 'they didn't know', 'it was nothing', and even if it was, then 'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'.\"\n\"I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through.\n\"Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves.\"\nAs the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry.\nThe Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible.\nBut by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs.\n\"We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria.\"\n\"I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone.\"\nMr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones.\n\"I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all,\" he said.\n\"I think I'm probably the last now. There was another of the footballers who I got Christmas cards from, but there was nothing this year. So at 94, I think it's probably time to tell the story before it's too late.\"",

But \"honest people will not face any problem\", he added.\nAfter Mr Modi's surprise announcement on Tuesday night, the banks were closed on Wednesday.\nThousands of panicked Indians have been flocking to banks since they reopened on Thursday.\nThere are limits on cash withdrawals from ATMs and banks.\nThe 500 ($7; \u00c2\u00a36) and 1,000 ($15; \u00c2\u00a312) rupee notes are the highest denomination notes in the country and are extremely common in India. Airports, railway stations, hospitals and fuel stations will only accept them until the end of today.\nPeople will be able to exchange their money at banks between 10 November and 30 December.\nThe actual figure is unclear but correspondents say the issue of \"black money\" - which may have been acquired corruptly, or is being withheld from the tax authorities - is a huge problem. India's government hopes to flush out tax evaders and make money that is unaccounted for visible for tax purposes. There have been reports of tax raids in many parts of India.\nAn individual can put as much as he or she likes into the bank - but withdrawals are limited so the banking system may end up being flooded with cash.\nGovernment guidelines say it is possible to exchange up to 4,000 rupees per day up to 24 November - anything over this will be subject to tax laws. People can also withdraw up to 10,000 rupees from a bank per day and a maximum of 20,000 rupees per week.\nNew 2,000 and 500 rupee denomination notes with new security features are being given to people to replace those removed from circulation.\nA new 1,000 rupee note \"with a new dimension and design\" will also be introduced in due course, a senior government official said on Thursday.\nThey can purchase foreign exchange equivalent to 5,000 rupees using these bank notes at airport exchange counters until midnight on Friday.",

        "document": "The 25-year-old wing has crossed codes from Super League side Wigan Warriors, in arguably the most high-profile switch since Sam Burgess' move to Bath.\nBurgess' time in union only lasted a year, but Chorley-born Charnley is hoping he can take to the game more naturally.\n\"I just want to learn it and not have to ask where I should be stood. I just want to have it free-flowing,\" he told BBC Sport.\nSince his move to Sale was announced in March, Charnley has been to the AJ Bell Stadium to watch the team as much as possible.\nWith his focus on league as a youngster, he did not grow up watching the Premiership, Six Nations or England internationals.\n\"I've wanted to try union for a while,\" he added.\n\"I've been lucky enough to be successful in league and achieve things that not many people can achieve so when the opportunity came to switch codes, I couldn't turn it down.\n\"I've been watching a lot of games and analysing it. It is one of those where I need to watch as much as I can as I need to know what I need to be doing.\"\nCharnley said he was having to adapt to a different way of training and the pace of the game in union.\n\"I was doing some clearing out the other day and it hurt my neck,\" Charnley said with a wry smile.\n\"It is getting my body used to it. I'm used to running between two people and getting up and down and this is different.\n\"It's good, it's a new challenge and I'm excited for it all.\"\nHe signed off with his hometown club in the perfect way, scoring a try at the Grand Final at Old Trafford as Wigan beat Warrington 12-6 last month.\nHis stats in rugby league were staggering - 165 tries in 176 appearances - and Sharks director of rugby Steve Diamond does not want to suppress that natural ability to cross the whitewash.\n\"We're not going to take away anything that he has already got, we can't enhance that at all at the moment,\" said 48-year-old ex-Sale hooker Diamond.\n\"We have a good management structure here. We understand what we're bringing from one sport to another and the differences in the codes.\n\"We have to settle him in; we don't want to rush him in. I think he will be nothing like the Sam Burgess affair that happened.\"\nThere is a long line of Wigan players moving to union, and in recent times both Chris Ashton and Joel Tomkins have become cross-code internationals, but still the most successful was Jason Robinson's switch.\nEngland head coach Eddie Jones has spoken about Charnley as having the ability to join the list of players who have represented their country in both codes.\n\"The potential is there, without a doubt,\" former Sharks and England winger Mark Cueto told North West Tonight.\n\"You don't want to pile the pressure on him but he has the ability to do it, and I'm sure he will.\n\"He has such a good career so far, so as a long as he does that in a Sale shirt then he is always going to have a sniff.\"\nAsked if he thought about running out at Twickenham, Charnley added: \"Any player wants to play for their country. You want to put that jersey on.\n\"If I'm lucky enough to be successful enough to get picked then it will be a nice thing on my CV.\"",

        "document": "The hosts had been on top when the ball came off forward Sanchez's hand and ended up in the net on 34 minutes. He added a penalty in injury-time which was awarded after Sam Clucas was sent off for handball from Lucas Perez's header.\nIn between, Hector Bellerin and Sanchez both failed to hit the target and Mesut Ozil volleyed over the crossbar for Arsenal.\nStriker Oumar Niasse had Hull's best chances - his header and low strike forced Petr Cech into sharp saves - while Adama Diomande nodded over late on.\nArsenal had been pressing for the opener before Sanchez's intervention.\nThe visitors failed to clear Kieran Gibbs' low shot and as the ball ricocheted off goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic on the ground it bounced off the Chilean's hand and into the net.\nFor a deliberate handball, Football Association laws state:\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOn this occasion, Sanchez did not look like he purposefully pushed the ball into the net and he had little time to move out of the way after the ball came off Jakupovic.\nAfter consultation with his assistant, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded the goal, but prior to that in the first half, Theo Walcott had a shot blocked by the hand of Clucas inside the area, for which no penalty was given.\nAfter the game, Hull defender Andrew Robertson told Sky Sports that Clattenburg had apologised to the Hull players after half-time.\nRobertson added: \"The ref told us he didn't give it because he wasn't 100% sure. Not many referees can admit they're wrong, so it's good when he does, though it doesn't make things better.\"\nNews app users should click this link to vote\nChasing the game in the second half, Hull's Lazar Markovic was running onto a long punt forward deep in the Arsenal half.\nThe Serb was barged down by Gibbs, who was the last defender, and had the on-loan Liverpool man not been infringed, he would have had a clear run through on goal from 30 yards.\nClattenburg spotted the incident and presented a yellow card.\nGibbs said after the game: \"I took a chance with the challenge on Markovic. The ref said the ball was going away from goal.\"\nWhen asked if Gibbs should have been sent off, Hull boss Marco Silva said: \"Yes. It is true. Markovic go to the goal.\"\nWith Hull pushing for an equaliser, they were hit on the counter by the home side. Jakupovic came sprinting off his line as Sanchez went round him and picked out Perez at the back post, but the Spaniard's goal-bound header was kept out by Clucas' arm on the line. Clucas was given a red card for the incident.\nSanchez stepped up to take the penalty, drilling a low finish into the net, which was his seventh goal against Hull in just four games.\nIt was also his 17th top-flight strike this season, making him the league's leading marksman.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nArsenal had lost back-to-back league games against Watford and Chelsea to leave their title challenge in disarray.\nBut the win moves them up to third in the table, nine points behind leaders Chelsea.\nFor Hull, it was an unlucky defeat, having come close to scoring in both halves, but they have now failed to find the net in 12 of their 25 games - more than any other side.\nDespite the defeat, Tigers supporters will be buoyed by the impact made by new manager Silva as his side look well-equipped for a battle to stay in the top-flight, yet they remain in the relegation zone by a single point.\nFormer Hull defender Peter Swan on BBC Radio Humberside\nHull City's performance was strong, and they did really all they could. The referee's decisions have hurt Hull today, but the side are showing they have got a very real chance of staying up.\nFor the second goal, you have got to feel sorry for Clucas. His keeper has stitched him right up. It was an easy decision for Clattenburg.\nAnd do you want to know the irony? Jakupovic had probably made up the ground and was covering behind Clucas, not that the defender knew.\nArsene Wenger speaking to Match of the Day: \"We were resilient, focused and organised, but a bit with the handbrake on as we were under pressure to win the game. In the end perhaps we were fortunate to get away with a positive result.\nHull boss Marco Silva told BBC Sport: \"The most important thing is the result. It was a very good second half. We had control of it and caused Arsenal problems.\n\"They started the game better than us and after the story of the first half they score with handball.

We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen.\"\nMr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK.\nHe said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome \"might come today, it might come next week\".\nThere was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added.\nMr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was \"more fight in her\" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas.\nHe told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was \"unpredictable\" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased.\nSpeaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: \"I have watched her grow up on Skype.\n\"She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English.\n\"Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing.\"\nMr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter.\nAmnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a \"prisoner of conscience\" who was being held for \"peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association\".\nRisk campaign manager Kathy Voss added: \"Though she shouldn't even find herself in this awful position, we very much hope the appeal will rule in Nazanin's favour and order her immediate release.\"",

        "document": "This is the full statement to the inquests from his niece, Ms Natalie Tennant, on behalf of his brother, Peter Copoc:\nStephen Paul Copoc was born on 1 August 1968, and was aged 20 years when he died at Hillsborough.\nStephen was the baby of our family, and the apple of our Mum's eye. Our family consisted of Mum and Dad, I, Peter, my sister Angela and then our Stephen. I was 10 years old when Stephen was born. Angela was just seven years old.\nOur Dad took us to the hospital, so that we could meet our new baby brother. Mum and Dad said that Angela and I could name him, and we did. Financially, we had little, but our parents, Agnes and Harold, made sure that there was lots of love in our house.\nStephen was such a joy to all of us. Mum and Dad only received good reports from Stephen's school regarding his conduct and application to his lessons.\nProfiles of all those who died\nStephen's personality was such that people warmed to him instantly as he had an easy way with him. He was popular with teachers and made friends, having the ability to also keep friends. The friends that he made when he was small were still his close friends when he died on that awful day.\nWhen we moved from Garston to our new house in Speke, Stephen had no problems adapting to the new environment, getting to know our new neighbours and making friends in an effortless and  uncomplicated way.\nI started work at 17. There was a shop in Garston called Smiths that sold everything. It's gone now. I bought Stephen a train set when I got paid. He was about nine at the time and wanted one.\nAs Angela and I were so much older than him, we kind of spoilt him, as he was such a lovable kid. I remember us both setting up the train set together and the joy Stephen got playing with it.\nHe was so careful about his toys. When he finished playing with the train set, he would put it away neatly. He minded his toys.\nHe used to follow Angela everywhere, even if she was going out to meet friends he would follow her and she would complain to Mum and Dad about having to bring 11 him.\nHowever, one day someone told Angela that there was an accident on the road and that Stephen was hurt. Angela ran down the cinder path near our home towards the school crying.\nWhen she got there, she was told he had not waited for the lollipop lady and got a bump from a car. He was physically fine, but Angela was sobbing and so distressed at the thought that Stephen was hurt.\nAngela was so good to Stephen and minded him throughout his childhood. All her friends knew him well because he was like her shadow.\nStephen started to take an interest in birds when he was about 12 years old. He started to study them and could tell you the name of most birds as well as their  eggs. It was also around this time that he became interested in fishing.\nWe had cousins that were avid fishermen and they took him along to Speke Hall, which is a rural setting in a National Trust estate right in the middle of Liverpool. He just loved fishing there and knew all about the fish that lived in the waters there.\nHe seldom, if ever, brought fish home to Mum and Dad. It was a joke in our house about Stephen catching fish, but he preferred to put the fish back into the water.\nWe think it was the birds and the fishing that started Stephen wanted to work out of doors. He appreciated being outdoors.\nHe finished school at 16 years of age and studied for his City and Guilds in Botany and Horticulture. He could name any flower and plant and was perfectly at home with nature.\nHe applied for and got a job with the Liverpool Parks and Gardens based in Calderstones Park. He treasured his job and became a gardener at Sudley Hall in Mossley Hill.\nHe loved his work, the people he worked with, he enjoyed meeting all the visitors and telling them about the gardens.\nWhen Stephen was about 15 years old, he met his girlfriend Jackie. They were very much in love and were engaged to be married when he died.\nStephen knew what he wanted from life. He was very close to our Mum and his main ambition in life was to save enough money to buy our parents a house. He did not want them living in rented accommodation.\nHe was mature and sensible for his age. He took out insurance policies in case anything happened to him, as he wanted our parents to have some money.\nHe was very caring to his nieces and nephews. When Angela's marriage broke down and she was on her own with her two children, Sean and Carla, Stephen with his  girlfriend Jackie would babysit and play with the children, keeping them amused for hours.\nHe could have been out with his mates but knew that Angela needed time alone and his family always came first with him.\nStephen, of course, loved football. His love of football and of Liverpool came from our Dad. The whole family travelled around to watch the matches, but not since 1989.\nAfter 1989, we gave the season tickets back and we never went to a football match again.\nStephen loved to play football as well. He was not the best of players, but he was like an encyclopaedia when it came to anything about football generally.\nStephen was a great music fan. He was always playing Pink Floyd and, in particular, 'Shine on you Crazy Diamond'. He always loved Marillion and went to concerts with his four close friends.\nOur parents never got over Stephen's death and the way he died. Our brother Stephen was one of life's genuine nice guys.\nOur Stephen was just 20 years of age, but had maturity and a caring attitude towards others and even from a young age carried a donor card.\nWe miss Stephen from our family and think about what might have been for all of us as a family if Stephen had not died on that awful day. Thank you.",

        "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe Sweden striker, who is out of contract after four years at Paris St-Germain, could follow former manager Jose Mourinho to Old Trafford.\nFootball finance expert Rob Wilson says the 34-year-old would be United's most marketable player since Cristiano Ronaldo, and linking up with the three-time European champions would be a \"match made in heaven\".\nWilson says Ibrahimovic's shirt sales alone would help cover the cost of finishing fifth in the Premier League this season and missing out on the riches of playing in Europe's elite competition, worth up to \u00a350m.\n\"It would not surprise me if Zlatan sold more shirts than Ronaldo or Lionel Messi,\" Wilson, a lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University, told BBC Sport.\n\"The cost of missing out on the Champions League is \u00a330-50m. Zlatan will help plug that gap significantly with the number of shirts shifted by United.\n\"It is a match made in heaven. The football club is commercially so aware who will exploit every commercial opportunity.\n\"To them, they are signing a player who understands commercial endorsements and behaves in a way that allows him to maximise them.\n\"Put that together and you get the holy grail stakes of shirt sales, and stacks of corporate sponsorship.\n\"Zlatan is also the sort of player who brings ad hoc ticket buyers to a match, even if it is the Europa League or League Cup.\n\"It is matching the world's biggest sporting brands with one of the most marketable players, who has cult following, plus it is his career swansong.\n\"If you marry that with Manchester United, he will probably shift more shirts in the next year than any player in the squad because of the superstar status that he has.\"\nWilson claimed that Ibrahimovic could become the face of Manchester United.\n\"Zlatan has a global profile, and global appeal,\" he said. \"Fans will buy shirts with Ibrahimovic on the back in Africa, South East Asia - markets United had a foothold in but not the leverage.\n\"Only a few select few players can do that: Gareth Bale, Neymar, Lionel Messi and Ronaldo.\"\nIf they are the off-pitch benefits of signing Ibrahimovic, what else will the enigmatic Swede bring to Old Trafford and the Premier League?\nSince making his debut for his hometown club of Malmo in 1999, Ibrahimovic has played for some of Europe's biggest clubs: Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan and PSG, commanding transfer fees of more than \u00a3120m.\nHe has scored 392 goals in 677 games and last season was his most prolific, with 50 goals in 51 matches - a record for PSG - while his 38 league goals is also a club record.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIbrahimovic does not do ordinary goals. He scored four against England in a friendly in 2012, including an amazing overhead kick and then there are the free-kicks, long-range goals, back-heels, flicks and scorpion goals.\nManchester United's FA Cup victory on Saturday was their first trophy since the Premier League title in 2013, when Sir Alex Ferguson retired.\nBut Ibrahimovic is used to regular success and has won 12 trophies in four seasons at PSG, including the domestic quadruple twice.\nWhile he may not have the same Ballon d'Or collection as Messi or Ronaldo, at least Ibrahimovic can console himself with being - beyond doubt - the best player in Sweden.\nThe striker has won a record 10 Guldbollen (Golden Ball), the award given to the best male footballer in his home country.\nIbrahimovic is one of the most quotable figures in world football. Here are just a few examples:\nJohanna Franden, international football correspondent for Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, has spent four years in Paris reporting on Ibrahimovic.\n\"He will play up to that image that people had of him,\" Franden told BBC Sport.\n\"When he says these things there is still a smile behind it, but for the last 15 years he has had so many people telling him how good he is that I think he does believe all of it.\"\nIbrahimovic has always enjoyed a spiky relationship with the media and his critics.\nIn 2015, after the semi-final of the French League Cup, he ordered his team-mates not to talk to journalists. When questioned why, he said: \"Because I am the boss.\"\n\"Only God knows\" was Ibrahimovic's answer when quizzed by a journalist about Sweden's chances against Portugal in the 2014 World Cup play-offs.\n\"Well, it's a bit hard to ask him\", the reporter said, to which the player replied: \"You're talking to him now.\"\nOn another occasion, he was forced to apologise for describing France in not so endearing terms.\n\"There will be a clash [with the media],\" said Franden. \"He will not hold back. He is not scared by the media; he will tell the journalists what he thinks.\n\"You expect if there is any discontent it will leak out.\n\"He can handle the pressure, but he keeps his private life private, he does not invite the press in and his partner Helena Seger will be in the limelight more than she has been so far.\"\nIbrahimovic could soon be linking up with England captain Wayne Rooney.\nIn a BBC documentary, he said of Rooney: \"I'd prefer to have him in my team than play against him. I've not been lucky enough to play with him but I enjoy seeing him on the pitch. If I cannot play with him, I will watch him.\"\nBut it is fair to say Ibrahimovic has not always enjoyed the best relationship with team-mates and it is safer to stay on his good side.\nHe once put AC Milan team-mate Gennaro Gattuso in a bin after a training session, in retaliation for being teased by the Italian.\nA fight with AC Milan team-mate and 6ft 5in American Oguchi Onyewu ended with a broken rib for Ibrahimovic, he once threatened to break Ajax team-mate Rafael van der Vaart's legs and another time he hit Mido after the Egyptian threw a pair of scissors at him.\nEarlier this year, Ibrahimovic told his PSG team-mates at half-time to \"play as I tell you and everything will be fine\".\n\"It is a good time for him to go to United, as there is not such a clear leader in the squad,\" said Franden.\n\"If he goes to United it is because Mourinho has told him he will be the number one, the most important voice in the locker room.\n\"Zlatan wants to be the most important player on the pitch. He is not a leader in the way he talks, but he expects team-mates to listen to him especially when he is not happy. He is also extremely demanding of himself.\n\"He will be a good example to the young players in how disciplined he is and how hard he works. He is always early for training and one of the last to leave. He eats healthy and does not drink or smoke.\"\nFormer United assistant manager Rene Meulensteen told BBC Radio 5 live: \"In some ways Ibrahimovic is the perfect fit for Manchester United at this moment in time. They have young players in the dressing room and he is a leader, a winner.\n\"He would bring a lot to the club and really put United back to winning ways\"\nIbrahimovic is joining United to link back up with Mourinho, who coached him at Inter Milan for a season from 2008-09.\n\"From being a cat, I felt like a lion,\" was how Ibrahimovic described the impact of Mourinho in an interview with Radio 5 live.\n\"He was amazing. He dragged out of me things that no other coach has done before. When I played I felt like a Terminator, I felt so confident under him.\"\nIn his book I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic, he described Mourinho as a manager he was \"willing to die for\".\n\"The first time he met my partner Helena, he whispered to her: 'Helena, you have only one mission: feed Zlatan, let him sleep, keep him happy'.\"\n\"Mourinho knows what he is bringing. Zlatan has always wanted to work with him again,\" said Franden.\n\"He had been very eager and was disappointed Mourinho had not got him in before.\n\"He said at Inter that Mourinho was the best he had worked with and was disappointed Mourinho has, until now, not picked up the phone to ask him to come. Mourinho has always praised Zlatan.\n\"When Zlatan left Inter some players said they were two seconds away from getting physical with each other. There was not enough air to breathe but Zlatan is willing to work with him. They are two big egos and they do clash.\"\n\"If Mourinho lights up a room, Guardiola draws the curtains,\" wrote Ibahimovic about former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola, who takes over at Manchester City next season.\nHe referred to the Spaniard as a \"spineless coward\" in his autobiography, and Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed Ibrahimovic said he \"might punch Pep\" during his time at Barcelona.\nBarcelona bought Ibrahimovic for \u00a357m and he scored 21 goals in 51 matches, but he felt he was used incorrectly by Guardiola and once confronted him on the training ground over lack of playing time.\n\"I said I was being used in the wrong way and that they shouldn't have bought me if they wanted another type of player,\" he wrote about a meeting with Guardiola.\n\"I told him what a friend had said to me: 'You bought a Ferrari but drive it like a Fiat.'\"\nExpect fireworks at the Manchester derby next season.\nFormer team-mate Peter Schmeichel said Ibrahimovic could have the same affect at Old Trafford as Eric Cantona, the iconic French striker.\n\"United need inspirational players, players that stand alone,\" said the former Denmark keeper.\n\"We had Cantona in the mid-90s. A lot of what happened in the 1990s would not have happened without him. Now it is time to have someone like that again. Zlatan fits that bill.\n\"In the last five years Zlatan has only improved his fitness, his abilities and output . His stats are unbelievable. Not just say in the French league, because he does it in Europe and for Sweden. He finds the goals, he finds the tricks, he finds what the crowd needs. I said this before, he was born to play for United.\"\nEx-United midfielder Paul Scholes added: \"Zlatan joining United does excite me. I know it might only be one or two years at the most, but he is a fit lad, looks after himself and is a great character, he could pull it off without a shadow of a doubt.\"\nBrazil left-back Maxwell and Ibrahimovic first met at Ajax in 2001 and have followed each other to Inter Milan, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain. They are close friends.\nThe pair have won 10 league titles together, so could we see Maxwell join his friend across the English Channel?\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",

        "document": "But VR can also be embedded in reality to give people more understanding of the world around them.\nIncreasingly it is being used as a tool by journalists, teachers, healthcare workers and retailers.\nThe BBC took a look at a few of the more unexpected uses of the technology.\nSurveys suggest that while 99% of people have heard of autism, only 16% really understand what it means. In the UK, more than a quarter of autistic people have been asked to leave a public place, such as a restaurant.\nIn order to address this, the UK's National Autistic Society made a VR film this summer to show people what it was like to live with the condition.\nThe film takes viewers on a journey with a young, autistic boy as he walks around a shopping centre. They can experience the sensory overload he experiences as he walks around.\nMark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, says he hopes the film will \"help the public understand a little more about autism\".\nThe film, along with Samsung Gear headsets, was taken on tour around UK shopping centres this summer and the charity is also putting together a pack for schools to teach their students about autism.\nThe film is available via an app and can be viewed on YouTube.\nAlzheimer's Research UK also released a VR film this summer, intended to put the public in the shoes of someone with dementia.\nA Walk Through Dementia aimed to show how everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea can be a challenge for someone with the condition.\nVirtual meatballs\nVirtual reality is becoming a common tool for people wanting to sell something. Estate agents use it to offer customers virtual walks from potential properties while Westfield shopping centre is using VR headsets to show off the latest fashion collections.\nIn April, furniture retailer Ikea launched an app that placed users in a fully furnished kitchen. Users could change the colours of the units and walk around the space. The app was available through Steam, using the HTC Vive.\nGamers are, said Ikea's Ingrid Franov, \"not a typical Ikea customer\" but the retailer was amazed by the reaction.\n\"In one month we had more downloads than we had expected for the whole six-months trial and people were asking for more kitchen action,\" she told delegates at the recent VR&AR World Forum in London.\n\"And what they wanted was meatball,\" she said.\nMeatballs are perhaps the most famous dish in Ikea's restaurants.\nWhen meatballs were added to the kitchen, one user told the firm: \"I want you all to know that I have just spent 44 minutes throwing meatballs around a virtual kitchen and I loved every second of it.\"\n\"This is really talking to customers,\" said Ms Franov.\nNow the retailer is considering rolling out the VR tool in stores to help customers better envisage how a kitchen design might look.\nHealthcare has become one of the big adopters of VR - using it both as  teaching aid and to treat phobias.\nSurgeon Dr Shafi Ahmed became one of the first to offer a live virtual surgery experience in April 2016 at the Royal London hospital.\nSome 5,000 people in 14 countries tuned in to watch the operation to remove a tumour.\nNow the start-up he co-founded, Medical Realities, is launching Virtual Surgeon as a product, hoping that such surgery can reduce the cost of training doctors, reach a much wider audience and ultimately \"democratise medicine\".\nMeanwhile, in the US, VR has been used to help soldiers deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and for arachnophobics to overcome their fear of spiders.\nIn one study, 23 people were encouraged to approach a virtual spider and by the end of the experiment, 83% showed significant improvement in how they could tolerate the situation.\nIn September 2015, Google launched Expeditions, a program designed to take thousands of school children around the world on a virtual trip - from the Great Barrier Reef to Mars.\nThe kit, which comprises a Google cardboard headset and an app, has just been launched in the UK.\nMost pupils have enjoyed the experience although one Year 3 student told the Times Educational Supplement that they \"were a bit scared of heights so if it could just be on the ground then that would be an improvement for me\".\nMarcus Storm is the founder of  VR start-up Evanescent Studios and he is developing a VR app that he hopes will be used in classrooms to improve language skills. The app is currently being trialled at Imperial College, with Mandarin as a pilot language.\nUsers can watch Chinese people having conversations and visit Chinese landmarks such as the Great Wall.\nMr Storm is enthusiastic about how VR can transform learning.\n\"We see a future where kids in history lessons are going back to revolutionary France and interacting with the people there,\" he said.\nIt is a view echoed by Nicholas Minter-Green, president of Economist Films.\n\"It is bringing the joy to education. The biggest challenge has always been to engage and that is where VR can be a very powerful tool,\" he said.\nAt VR&AR World Forum in London, he spoke about how Chinese firm NetDragon is testing how VR software and hardware can be used to tell if children are engaged in learning.\n\"One idea is that headsets could tell when children are tilting their heads, indicating boredom, meaning a change of subject or teaching method is required,\" he said.\nCash-strapped schools may struggle to afford the hardware or the computing power required for VR to run, and Mr Minter-Green acknowledged that there are many hurdles to overcome before virtual becomes a reality, in school at least.",

Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference.\"\nEvans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little.\nPerth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall.\n\"It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,\" she recalled. \"There were thousands of people cheering when we came out.\n\"We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated.\n\"I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background.

Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged.\n\"The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different.\n\"It is a different culture, a new way of playing, and that adds to the national team.\"",

The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle, Alderman and Mrs Howard.\nAs well as showing children at play, another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work.\nA nervous looking young maid for a well-to-do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900.\nThe exhibition has been put together by Kay Jones, Curator of Urban Community History at the Museum of Liverpool.\nMs Jones painstakingly trawled through hundreds of images from the National Museums Liverpool's collections before deciding on the final 25 for the exhibition.\nShe said: \"This has been a fascinating exhibition to work on.\n\"Looking through hundreds of different postcards, photographs and glass plate negatives in our collections; it was hard to decide on the final 25 images.\n\"I chose the ones that really stood out and told the experience of childhood.\n\"People love seeing old photographs and most people can relate to the same experiences of playing out in the street if they're from Liverpool or anywhere else.\n\"But, at the same time, the pictures also remind us of how things have changed.\n\"I didn't want it to be just happy memories, I also wanted to remember the children who had to work throughout their childhood.\n\"I wanted it to be the good and bad experiences of childhood.\"\nGrowing Up in the City is at the Museum of Liverpool until 25 September.",

        "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe Spaniard became the only man to win three times so far this season.\nHe drove a controlled race and stayed just far enough ahead of his pursuers to maintain the lead.\nGreat strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end\nButton climbed up from sixth on the grid to pass Vettel at the second pit stops but was re-passed with two laps to go.\nHowever, the Englishman was promoted to second place after race stewards gave Vettel a 20-second penalty for his overtake of Button on the penultimate lap.\nLewis Hamilton retired with gearbox damage after running well down the field following an early puncture. But he will not incur any penalty for a gearbox change because of his retirement.\nThe result extends Alonso's championship lead to 34 points ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber who had a low-key race to eighth place, never showing any real pace.\nAlonso said: \"It was tough, not an easy race. Maybe we were not the quickest in dry conditions but we were competitive and it was enough to maintain the lead.\n\"Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end, with Jenson putting pressure.\n\"But the car was feeling good on top speed and traction and that was enough to keep the lead into Turn 6, and after that overtaking is not so easy.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of his 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade.\nAt one stage, Hamilton unlapped himself on Vettel - although not Alonso - as he attempted vainly to recover from his early set-back. A move which angered the double world champion.\nAlonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their DRS overtaking aids to pass him into the hairpin at Turn 6.\nIt led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag.\nThe Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint.\nMeanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place.\nVettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier.\nVettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position.\nButton was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres.\nRather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed him at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap.\nVettel said: \"The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking.\n\"I am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that.\"\nButton said: \"It was a close race and I couldn't quite get Fernando at the end.\n\"When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you're in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don't need to push.\n\"It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back.\n\"But it was a fun race and it's nice to be on the podium again. I've had my feeling back the last two races but the pace hasn't been there [in the car], but today it was. We're there or thereabouts at the front, still a little way to go.\"\nRaikkonen provided some exciting racing as he moved up from 10th on the grid.\nOn the way, Raikkonen engaged in top-class racing with Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher and the Force Indias of Nico Hulkenberg and Paul di Resta.\nSchumacher finished seventh behind Sauber drivers Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Perez. Hulkenberg and Di Resta took the final points positions in ninth and 10th.",

        "document": "It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from iCloud.\nThe action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple's internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented.\nHowever, the security facility remains an opt-in choice.\nOne expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option.\nThe process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before.\nThey are also required to enter a four-digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app.\nIf the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase.\nThey can, however, use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen. They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out.\nWhile Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service.\nThat meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker.\nSeveral hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's \"forensic\" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad.\nElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was \"the only one able to do that\".\nHe has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used.\n\"I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround,\" Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account.\n\"The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled.\"\nHowever, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system.\n\"The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it,\" he said.\n\"And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back.\n\"Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies.\"\nBut another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test.\n\"We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.\n\"It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it.\n\"And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too.\"\nApple has told the Wall Street Journal that it \"plans to more aggressively encourage people\" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords.\n\"When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,\" chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper.\n\"I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing.\"",

        "document": "The government wants some households to pay more to raise money for education, and finance secretary Derek Mackay gave evidence to committee backing the plan.\nThe committee formally recommended the scheme to parliament after members voted four to two in favour of it.\nMembers also rejected an amendment from Green MSP Andy Wightman noting \"concerns\" about wider local tax plans.\nThe proposals would see the average band E household pay about \u00a32 per week more, and the average household in the highest band (H) about \u00a310 a week more.\nParliament has to pass an order, a piece of secondary legislation, to change the bands, and Mr Mackay has now won the formal backing of the committee for that. Members will submit a report to parliament, before the order is voted on by all MSPs at a later date.\nPutting forward a motion to have the committee recommend the move to parliament, Mr Mackay told its members that his plans would lead to a \"more progressive\" and \"fairer\" system of local taxation.\nMr Wightman lodged an amendment to the finance secretary's motion to \"note concerns\" about the fact the council tax base has not been updated since 1991 and recognising the recommendation of the Commission on Local Tax Reform that \"the present council tax system must end\".\nLabour's Elaine Smith backed Mr Wightman, saying the committee should \"reflect the evidence\" heard from members.\nBut SNP and Conservative members united against the amendment, with Tory Graham Simpson saying there \"isn't much point\" to adding it to the debate.\nMr Simpson also opposed Mr Mackay's original motion, saying it represented a \"fundamental change\" to the way local services are funded, and undermined local accountability.\nThe motion ultimately passed by four votes to two, with Ms Smith joining the three SNP members and Mr Wightman abstaining.\nThe committee will now compile a report on the issue for parliament, while it will be down to the parliamentary bureau to decide if there needs to be a further chamber debate on the issue as well as a vote.\nThe government was only saved from a chamber defeat over council tax in September when Labour leader Kezia Dugdale's vote failed to register.\nOpposition members had successfully amended a government motion promoting its council tax reform strategy, changing the wording to condemn the approach as undermining local accountability. But the final vote on the amended motion was tied after Ms Dugdale's vote was not counted.\nMr Wightman had also called for a revaluation of council tax bands during the committee debate, pointing out that the current bands were based on property values dating back to 1991.\nThe Green MSP said he had a constituent whose flat was in band E, but was worth \u00a320,000 less than neighbouring flats in band B.\nLabour's Elaine Smith pointed out that some council tax payers weren't even born when the council tax values of their properties were determined.\nMr Mackay said a \"costly\" revaluation would \"take time\" and could be a \"shock\" to many households - with some potentially facing \"astronomically high\" tax increases under a full revaluation.\nBut he said the changes to bands were \"not the end of the story in terms of local tax [reform]\", saying the government was taking a \"balanced approach\" while seeking to \"make council tax more progressive\".\nThe Scottish government has started the process of reforming local taxation following on from the Commission on Local Tax Reform, which called for a fairer, more transparent and progressive tax to fund local services.\nOpposition members have accused the government of \"tinkering\" with the system rather than making bold reforms.\nThe Scottish Conservatives support an end to the council tax freeze and increases to the top two bands, but oppose the changes to bands E and F.\nBut Labour and the Greens both want to see the \"hated\" council tax scrapped, with Labour repeatedly accusing the SNP of abandoning an earlier promise to do so.",

        "document": "Ed Snowden, a 29-year-old former technical worker for the CIA, has since revealed himself to be the source of the leaks in an interview with the Guardian news website.\nUS director of national intelligence James Clapper described the leaks as \"extremely damaging\" to national security, but Mr Snowden said he had acted because he found the extent of US surveillance \"horrifying\".\nWhat could the US government see?\nAccording to the documents revealed by Ed Snowden, the US National Security Agency (NSA) has access on a massive scale to individual chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers and social networking data of individuals.\nThe US government confirmed it did request millions of phone records from US company Verizon, which included call duration, location and the phone numbers of both parties on individual calls.\nHow much do the spooks know?\nWhy every call matters\nWhat can you learn from phone records?\nAccording to the documents, Prism also enabled \"backdoor\" access to the servers of nine major technology companies including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple.\nThese servers would process and store a vast amount of information, including private posts on social media, web chats and internet searches.\nAll the companies named have denied their involvement, and it is unknown how Prism actually works.\nNational Security Agency (NSA) Director Keith Alexander said that the eavesdropping operations have helped keep Americans secure - yet cannot provide details. \"If we tell the terrorists every way that we're going to track them, they will get through and Americans will die,\" he said\nSome experts question its true powers, with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a \"catflap\" than a \"backdoor\".\n\"The spooks may be allowed to use these firms' servers but only in respect of a named target,\" he said.\n\"Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard-drive or similar.\"\nWhat about data-protection laws?\nDifferent countries have different laws regarding data protection, but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers, what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity.\nMost individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring.\nFacebook's privacy policy, for example, states: \" We use the information [uploaded by users] to prevent potentially illegal activities\".\nAre we all being watched?\nThe ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security, and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-rides protecting privacy.\n\"You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,\" said US President Barack Obama, defending US surveillance tactics.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran.\nSpeaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that \"law abiding citizens\" in Britain would \"never be aware of all the things... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up\".\nDoes it make a difference which country you live in?\nUser data (such as emails and social media activity) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves - Facebook for example has a clause in its privacy policy saying that all users must consent to their data being \"transferred to and stored in\" the US.\nThe US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in this way.\nThis method of storage is part of cloud computing, in which both storage and processing is carried out away from the individual's own PC.\n\"Most cloud providers, and certainly the market leaders, fall within the US jurisdiction either because they are US companies or conduct systematic business in the US,\" Axel Arnbak, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Information Law, told CBS News last year after conducting a study into cloud computing, higher education and the act.\n\"In particular, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments (FISA) Act makes it easy for US authorities to circumvent local government institutions and mandate direct and easy access to cloud data belonging to non-Americans living outside the US, with little or no transparency obligations for such practices - not even the number of actual requests.\"\nAre other governments involved?\nUK Foreign Secretary William Hague has so far refused to confirm or deny whether British government surveillance department GCHQ has had access to Prism.\nIt is not known whether other governments around the world have been either aware of or involved in the use of Prism, which is reported to have been established in 2007.\nIn a statement, the EU Justice Commission said it was \"concerned\" about the consequences of Prism for EU citizens and was \"seeking more details\" from the US authorities.\n\"Where the rights of an EU citizen in a Member State are concerned, it is for a national judge to determine whether data can be lawfully transmitted in accordance with legal requirements (be they national, EU or international),\" said a spokesperson for Justice Commissioner Vivane Reding.\nWhat does this mean for internet use?\nWilliam Hague insists that law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about, and there is no legal way of \"opting out\" of monitoring activity carried out in the name of national or global security.\nHowever privacy concerns about information uploaded to the internet have been around for almost as long as the internet itself, and campaign group Privacy International says the reported existence of Prism confirms its \"worst fears and suspicions\".\n\"Since many of the world's leading technology companies are based in the US, essentially anyone who participates in our interconnected world and uses popular services like Google or Skype can have their privacy violated through the Prism programme,\" says  Privacy International on its website.\n\"The US government can have access to much of the world's data, by default, with no recourse.\"\nEdward Snowden, the source of the leaked documents, said he had acted over concerns about privacy.\n\"I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,\" he told the Guardian.",

The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass.\"\nMorocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began.\nThe North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead.\nEarlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (\u00a3675,000) to $50,000 (\u00a334,000).\nEquatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.\nThe host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over.\n\"I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems,\" FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport.\nSeeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty.\nThe spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared.\nThe Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup.\nContrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.\n\"We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence,\" said Snoussi.\n\"But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium.\"\n\"But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. \"We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected.\n\"In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match.\"\nTunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement.\n\"Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,\" said Snoussi.\n\"We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out.\"\nFollowing last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F.\nShould the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.",

One can use the experience of previous students to benefit future students. An interesting fact is that the data of the interactions before the course actually starts, like reading the material available and engaging with forums, is extremely valuable.\n\"Currently it is deployed on 13 modules, mostly level one modules in order to try to provide timely indicators that students may be struggling.\n\"The model is tailored to each of the modules and by using this and identifying students, more tailored support may be provided.\"\nThe OU has taken steps to ensure that students' privacy is not compromised by the scheme - putting in place an ethics policy, agreed in consultation with a student committee, to protect their data.\nRuth Tudor, president of the Open University's Students' Association, thinks the scheme is a positive one.\n\"It's a great idea and a great way of providing targeted support to students who may be struggling and need extra help,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I would like to think that this would improve the drop-out rate from OU courses. You must remember they take students who have come from no academic background so it is always possible that those people take on more than they think they can manage.\n\"That's why data analytics will help provide extra support and can help them be successful.\"\nReports suggest that some other British universities are thinking of using similar methods and Ms Tudor added: \"I don't see why this shouldn't happen in other universities.

        "document": "Imran Khawaja tried to sneak back into the UK last year - and while his exact activity in Syria remains a mystery, police say he is one of the most dangerous British jihadists to return from conflict.\nHe was one of the most public British fighters in Syria - always online, but always masked.\nBut now, Imran Khawaja, 27, from Southall, west London is facing a possible prison term up to life imprisonment for his role in life and death on Syria's battlefields.\nKhawaja left the UK last January. He called himself Abu Daigham al-Britani. And after reaching the warzone via Kurdish territory, he began posting videos and pictures of his personal jihad.\nIn one video he explains how a fellow fighter was shot through the side - but \"thanks to Allah's will\" was soon back on the front line. In another - masked again - he is showing off his amateur weight-lifting skills as his brothers-in-arms cheer him on.\nKhawaja was a member of Rayat al Tawheed - which means Flag of Unity. The group of fighters affiliated to Islamic State includes many British men, and they have spent more than a year selling a message to their supporters and would-be recruits back home.\nKhawaja was involved in appeals for donations, video diaries of their lives  and \"through the keyhole\" tours of fighters' quarters.\nShiraz Maher, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR), at Kings College London, has been tracking foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq.\nHe says: \"The group that Khawaja was with in Syria was really quite dynamic,\" he says. \"They clearly had people with programming skills - they were able to put together very slick, well produced propaganda videos and posters that appealed to young British Muslims.\n\"They were able to play on the same cultural anchors and mores that those people recognised and know. They could speak to them as peers.\n\"Rayat al Tawheed helped a great deal in the early stages of this conflict with portraying the idea of volunteering as a jihadist as quite a glamorous adventurous thing - and a noble thing.\"\nBut Rayat's war was neither noble nor glamorous. Some of its material online showed gruesome scenes of death. One image showed a man's bloodied-hands with the caption \"my first time\".\nAnd another shocking image included Imran Khawaja. In this gruesome picture, the Londoner - masked yet again - is holding a bag that contains a head.\nThe only thing we know about the victim is that he was supposedly a Syrian army soldier. But we do know that the British security service MI5 was watching - and waiting.\nAnd last June, its opportunity came.\nImran Khawaja decided to come home. It's not clear why because he hasn't told the police.\nHis cousin Tahir Bhatti, a taxi driver from Watford, agreed to help him return because the family wanted him back safely. Khawaja's own intentions are unclear. He had originally asked his cousin for money for a new gun - something Bhatti did not help him with. And then the fighter began trying to cover his tracks.\nAs Bhatti, who has admitted assisting an offender, drove to Bulgaria to pick him up, Khawaja faked his own death with an online obituary that said he had died in battle.

This is a dangerous man.\"\nImran Khawaja was considered so dangerous that while he was on remand, he was held in the special unit for high risk terrorism suspects at London's maximum security Belmarsh prison.\nHe has admitted four offences:\nTahir Bhatti has pleaded guilty to assisting an offender.\nKhawaja had originally faced an additional charge of soliciting to murder. That allegation, the most serious to be made yet against a Syrian fighter, will lie on file.",

He was recalled to prison in 2010.\nHe had been released from prison in 2001, having served seven years of a life sentence, but was recalled when he pleaded guilty to downloading and distributing indecent images of children.\nMrs Fergus, speaking to the BBC to mark the 20th anniversary of the killing, said: \"Do not release him. I still don't think he's capable of walking amongst other people.\n\"He will do someone else harm. It's in him, and I strongly believe if he's released he will go on to hurt someone else.\"\nThompson, who was also released in 2001 after eight years in detention, was given a new secret identity and address.\nVenables was aged 10 when he and Thompson abducted and murdered James, beating him with bricks and iron bars and leaving his body on a railway line.\nJames' mother described it as \"a stupid, silly little mistake\" of hers to let go of her child's hand for a few seconds on 12 February 1993 at the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle.\nShe said it \"still feels so raw to this day\".\n\"I still can't understand how it happened, or why it happened.\"\nMrs Fergus set up a charity, named after her son, to support young people who have become the victims of crime, hatred or bullying.\nAsked if, after 20 years, she should move on, Mrs Fergus said: \"Why should I let it go? They took the most precious thing away from me. I won't let it go. And I've always said if there's a fight there to be fought, then I'll fight it for James.\n\"If I let go of that now I will feel I've let James down.  That is something I'll never do, I'll never let James down. I want justice for James. He's never had justice.\"\nShe has campaigned to have both men kept in prison, and said: \"I did warn [the authorities] that one of them or both of them would go on to reoffend, and I was proven right with Venables.\"\nShe said her family - her husband and three sons - mention James often. \"I think the day I stop talking about him is the day I give up on life, but I'll never stop talking about him, never stop remembering him.\"",

McLaren have contracts with both men.\nWilliams said they could not comment on driver contracts and Button said he had not yet considered his future.\n\"I've had a lot of questions thrown at me about what I am doing next year but I have not thought about anything, seriously,\" the 35-year-old said.\n\"I just have to get my head down and concentrate on improving the car and then in a couple of months we will sit down and talk about next year.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBottas, on whom Williams have an option for the next two seasons, said he \"did not know\" whether he would be at Williams next season.\n\"Nothing is confirmed,\" the Finn said. \"We have to wait and see. As a driver, you want to know as soon as possible but sometimes you have to wait.\"\nAlthough Ferrari have pursued various options, sources close to the team say they have decided to put off a decision on Raikkonen's future until later in the summer.\nFerrari president Sergio Marchionne said last month that Raikkonen's \"future is in his own hands\" amid concerns at the team that he is not performing well enough compared to team-mate Sebastian Vettel.\nThese come on the back of his poor season in 2014 during which he was comprehensively out-performed by former team-mate Alonso.\nFerrari technical director James Allison said this week in an interview with an Italian magazine that Raikkonen was as fast as Vettel but that his results were being affected by the fact he was making more mistakes.\nRaikkonen said: \"I don't know any more than I knew at the start of the year. For me, the whole thing hasn't changed for months. If I knew I would easily say. Unfortunately I don't know.\n\"Somehow I end up every year in the same position, and it makes no difference if I have a contract or not. There is no contract, but there is an option now.\n\"I have made it very clear to the team what I would like to happen, and it is to be here next year.\"\nIf Bottas leaves and Button stays at McLaren, Williams may still look to McLaren's driver pool for a partner for Felipe Massa, on whom they have an option and is expected to stay.\nMagnussen and Vandoorne could both be of interest to Williams.",

If I had known, I could have rationalised it but at the time I felt embarrassed.\n\"I started thinking 'maybe it is me, maybe I'm doing something wrong.'\"\nOn Monday, the watchdog published 21 reports into schools allegedly targeted as part of a hardline Muslim takeover.\nFive of those schools, including Park View and Oldknow, were rated inadequate.\n'Islamic-themed assemblies'\nBirmingham City Council said it would work with Saltley School, the only local authority school placed in special measures, and the Department for Education to install a temporary governing board.\nIn a letter to Park View chairman Tahir Alam, education minister Lord Nash said there were \"deep concerns\" about the way Park View School was run.\nThe letter said: \"I have decided under clause 5.6 of the supplementary funding agreement for the academy to give written notice of the Secretary of State's intention to terminate that agreement.\"\nLord Nash criticised the trust for failing to promote \"spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils\".\n\"I am deeply mindful of the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations,\" he said.\nA similar letter about Nansen Primary School, also addressed to Tahir Alam, said it would have its funding arrangement terminated.\nBoth letters invited the trust to respond before 4 July.\nA spokesman for Park View School said they would challenge the Ofsted report through the appropriate legal channels.\nThey said terminating the funding agreement would mean the trust could be removed from the running of the three schools.\n\"What happens to the schools after that would be the decision of the secretary of state, as they are already academy schools under the remit of [the] Department for Education,\" they said.\nIn a letter to Dr Achmad da Costa, chair of Oldknow Academy Trust, Lord Nash said it was not meeting the requirements set out in its funding agreement.\n\"Therefore the Secretary of State is minded to terminate the funding agreement unless all the breaches are addressed promptly, in full, and to his satisfaction,\" it said.\nLord Nash set out a list of actions the trust must take before 4 July.\nThese included ending \"less favourable\" treatment of non-Muslims, ceasing segregation of boys and girls, and drawing up a plan to ensure a more \"broad and balanced\" curriculum.\nOldknow Academy declined to comment on the letter from Lord Nash.\nA letter to Tahir Alam regarding Golden Hillock's funding arrangement set out a similar list of demands to be completed within the same timescale.\nOfsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said \"a culture of fear and intimidation has taken grip\" in Birmingham schools, while a number of head teachers had reported an \"organised campaign to target certain schools in order to impose a narrow, faith-based ideology\".\n'Own agendas'\nThe report into Park View School said the academy's work to keep students safe, including from extremism, was inadequate.\nIt said external speakers had not been vetted properly and the school had allowed a guest with known extremist views to speak to students as part of Islamic-themed assemblies.\nPark View and Oldknow trusts did not comment on the future but one of Saltley School's senior teachers said it hoped to boost its Ofsted rating.\nDarren Turner was brought in as associate head teacher on Thursday as part of a partnership scheme with other local schools.\nHe said there had been \"upset\" among staff and pupils at Saltley's inadequate rating.\n\"This is all about moving forward, what happens next,\" he said.\n\"Behind these walls they've got some excellent teachers and they want to get back to doing what they are good at: teaching.\n\"When this school gets back to 'good' again we want to go further and become outstanding.\"\nParents at the schools have criticised Ofsted's reports and accused inspectors of bias.\nHealth professional Arshad Malik told the BBC the findings were  \"alien\" to his child's experience at Park View.\n\"\u00e2\u20ac\u017dInspectors came with loaded questions,\" he said.\n\"People are trying to use this school to push their own agendas.\"\nHe said parents would like to invite Education Secretary Michael Gove to the school for an open meeting about Ofsted's findings and to talk about what evidence was found to support them.",

be it the police or anybody else.\"\nChairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, was killed, said: \"This is definitely the start of the end.\n\"I think everybody needs that, I think we all need peace from Hillsborough but we can never have peace until we've got truth, justice, accountability.\n\"I think that's the time we'll all have peace.\"\nBarry Devonside, whose son Christopher, 18, was killed in the disaster, said: \"Everybody applauded when it was announced that the most senior police officer on that particular day will have charges presented to him.\"\nEvelyn McDonnell Mills, whose brother Peter McDonnell, 21, died, said she was \"really happy\", but sad that her brother who campaigned for years and died during the new inquests never got to see their conclusion.\nPete Weatherby QC, who represents 22 of the victims' families, said they had \"always known that accountability is the most difficult objective\".\n\"They remain keen to see the criminal process properly pursued for those who have been charged and given that, the rights of the defendants should be respected.\n\"They do however hope that the memories of their loved ones and the integrity of the fans who attended Hillsborough will be respected during the process.\"\nBBC News profiles of all those who died\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said: \"I know from working closely with the families when I was home secretary that this will be a day of mixed emotions for them.\"\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn offered a \"tribute to all of those that spent a great deal of time trying to ensure there was justice for those that died at Hillsborough\".\nDr Alan Billings, the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, said he hoped the start of criminal proceedings would \"lead to a measure of closure for the family members who have experienced a long and traumatic process\".\nSheffield Wednesday said the club had no comment to make.\nMr Duckenfield and Mr Denton's legal representative Ian Lewis, from JMW Solicitors, said: \"In light of the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to commence criminal proceedings against David Duckenfield and Donald Denton, it would be inappropriate for me as their solicitor, or for my clients themselves, to make any comment.\"\nMr Metcalf declined to comment.",

        "document": "During the first nine months of 1938, he oversaw the Czech Kindertransport, which brought Jewish children from German-occupied Czechoslovakia to safety in the UK.\nHe worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised and homes were found for the young refugees.\nYet, amazingly, his self-effacing manner meant that it was 50 years before the full story of his heroic efforts became public knowledge.\nNicholas George Winton was born on 19 May 1909 in the well-heeled Hampstead district of north London.\nHis Jewish parents had moved from Germany to London in 1907 and changed the family name from Wertheim to Winton.\nThey had also converted to Christianity and it was into that faith that their son was baptised.\nIn 1923, Winton became one of the first pupils at the newly opened Stowe School in Buckinghamshire. Although he left without attaining any qualifications, he had become imbued with a love of mathematics.\nHe continued his studies at evening classes before moving to Germany, where he worked in banks in Hamburg and Berlin.\nIn 1931, just two years before Hitler became German chancellor, he moved to work in Paris before returning to London.\nHis mother's family had remained in Germany and that, together with the stories of Jewish refugees fleeing to London, made him all too aware of the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis.\nIn December 1938, Winton had been due to go on a skiing holiday to Switzerland when he suddenly decided to travel instead to Prague, where a friend was trying to help Jewish refugees.\nHe visited camps for refugees from the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia, which had been ceded to Germany in September 1938 following pressure on the Czech government from Britain and France.\nBritish activists were already working in Czechoslovakia trying to help the refugees, but Winton's great idea was to rescue children by finding families in the UK to give them a home.\nHe was helped by a 1938 Act of Parliament that permitted the entry of refugee children under the age of 17, as long as money was deposited to pay for their eventual return home.\nWinton set up an office in a hotel in Prague, where he was quickly besieged by families desperate to get their children out before Germany invaded Czechoslovakia.\nOn his return to London, he worked with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kindertransport, just one of a number of  initiatives attempting to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-occupied territories.\nWinton placed dozens of newspaper advertisements pleading for people to come forward and offer children a home. It was not always easy.\n\"The problem was getting the people who would accept the children, and of course this was at a time when the evacuation of children from the south [of England] was taking place anyway,\" he said.\n\"It's marvellous that so many people did come forward. The unfortunate thing was that no other country would come along and help.\n\"I tried America but they didn't take any. It would have made a vast difference if they had.\"\nIn the first eight months of 1939, eight trains left Prague taking 669 children to safety. A further 15 were flown out via Sweden.\nThe ninth train was scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland and triggered the outbreak of World War Two.\n\"Within hours of the announcement, the train disappeared,\" Winton later recalled. \"None of the 250 children on board was seen again.\n\"We had families waiting at Liverpool Street that day in vain. If the train had been a day earlier, it would have come through.\"\nWinton registered as a conscientious objector and served for a time as an ambulance driver, before joining the RAF where he was eventually commissioned.\nHe told no-one about his pre-war exploits and it was not until 1988 that his wife discovered a scrapbook in the attic containing a mass of documents, including the names of the rescued children.\nIn July of that year, Winton appeared on an edition of the BBC programme That's Life, and some of the people he had rescued were invited to attend.\nUntil they arrived in the studio, they had no idea that Winton was the man who had saved them.\nWinton was awarded an MBE in 1983 for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield care homes and, in 2003, was knighted in recognition of his efforts on the Kindertransport.\nIn 2007, he received the Czech Republic's highest military decoration, the Cross of the 1st Class, and was nominated by the Czech government for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize.\nA train dubbed \"The Winton Train\" left Prague station on 1 September 2009, exactly 70 years after the last Kindertransport had been due to depart from the Czech capital.\nIn October 2014, at the age of 105, he travelled to Prague to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, the Order of the White Lion.\nIn his acceptance speech, he was typically modest: \"In a way, I shouldn't have lived so long to give everyone the opportunity to exaggerate things the way they are doing today.\"\nIt was another Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who summed up the vital role of those who, like Winton, tried to save Europe's Jewish children from the Nazis:\n\"In those times there was darkness everywhere. In Heaven and on Earth, all the gates of compassion seemed to have been closed.\n\"The killer killed and the Jews died and the outside world adopted an attitude either of complicity or of indifference. Only a few had the courage to care.\"",

They also arrested her boyfriend, Ryan Lambert, who allegedly told officers he was to be paid $11,000 (\u00c2\u00a37,270) to drive the drugs to San Francisco.\nMs Henifin told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area, according to the complaint.\nThe three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges.\nThe wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms, and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are \"a large part of our practice\".",

Until now, any man who had ever had sex with another man was barred for life from donation.\nFrom 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales.   But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months.\nThis deferral period has been left in place because there is a \"window period\" after infection with blood-borne viruses where they are not detectable.\nThis window period is far less than 12 months.\nThe report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) says that for HIV it varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test.  For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, it is 66 days.\nIn Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay.  In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner.\nBy contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men.\nWhilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long.\nStonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. \"To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence.\"\nBut Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: \"The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses.\"\nA one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute.\nNHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate.\nThe hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors.\nIf you want more detail about the reasoning behind the decision to lift the ban, then the full report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) can be read here.",

The car had stolen licence plates and did not brake or stop.\n\"I am satisfied that having heard all the evidence... much of it circumstantial, nevertheless, in my view it is overwhelming.\n\"I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Barry John Pring has been unlawfully killed.\"\nShe said the case demonstrated the difficulty in investigating a case of a death abroad, adding: \"Our thoughts and condolences must go to the family who have endured years and years of distress and unhappiness.\"\nClose friend Peter Clifford, a lawyer, told the inquest he had \"no reasonable doubt\" that Barry was murdered.\nMs Ziuzina, known as Anna, was 19 years younger than her husband.

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry.\nWithin this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach.\nMy recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry.\nI exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000.\nAE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two.\nThe company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands.\nThis label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.\nIt's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.\nMany Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.",

        "document": "Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill.\nIt is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality.\nThe winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night.\nFormer Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist.\nAlso on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1.\nJacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J.\nIt features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as \"What Happened, If It Happened\".\nMukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism.\nInverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first.\nShe has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001.\nAmerican Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name.\nThe other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special.\nAustralia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two.\nOf all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen.\nThe next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May.\nThe announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later.\n\"It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,\" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading.\n\"The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies).\n\"John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either.\n\"It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books.\"\nThis year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner.\nLast year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner.\nThe shortlisted authors each receive \u00a32,500 and a specially bound edition of their book.\nCoverage from this year's ceremony, where the prize will be presented by the Duchess of Cornwall. will be on the BBC News Channel from 2130 BST and on BBC Arts.",

You were lucky this time.\" Kvyat shrugged: \"I'm on the podium; you're on the podium.\"\nIn the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: \"You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium.\"\nListen to Vettel's post-race rant\nAt the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner.\nIn the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass.\nRicciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front.\nMercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance.\nListen to the first-lap madness\nHamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race.\nSo Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart.\nHe began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr.\n\"The car was pretty damaged,\" said the 31-year-old afterwards. \"I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place.\"\nMercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a \"lot of aerodynamic performance\".\nAfter a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.\nChinese Grand Prix race results\nChinese Grand Prix coverage details",

        "document": "She had been contemplating the 50 hours she'd just spent crushed inside a tiny cupboard, hidden beneath a pile of clothes, with nothing but a bottle of body lotion to try to quench a raging thirst.\nThe sound of her friends being butchered in the courtyard outside echoed in her ears.\nCynthia, a 19-year-old student at Garissa's teacher training college on the edge of town, spoke with the studied politeness that I've encountered repeatedly in the past few days in this isolated town, on the hot, dry plains that stretch towards and over the seemingly notional border that separates Kenya from Somalia.\nThere have been plenty of tears from the survivors of Thursday's killings.\nBut when confronted by a foreign journalist, each student I met seemed too anxious to reach - more so than in any other similar situation I can remember - for some approximation of composure.\n\"I'm fine, thanks.\"\n\"Everything is fine now.\"\n\"Thank you for asking.\"\nI am very wary of reading too much into such things. But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable.\nI couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women.\nThese feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity.\nThey are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border.\nBut elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality.\nAl-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back.\nPerhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax.\nAt Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: \"Oh, I thought you were carrying guns.\"\nAnd yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon.\nFor two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy.\nBut Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya.\nThen, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast.\nTroops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with \"friendly\" warlords.\nSince then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya.\nRevenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere.\nThen there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation.\nIt has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast.\nAnd then there is Greater Somalia.\nIt is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa.\nAl-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges.\nBy attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area.\nNot that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite.\nYes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town.\nSurely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support.\nBut overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.",

The new openings held back the like-for-like sales total over the period, it added.\nChief executive John Walden, who said it had been \"another rather eventful period\" for the company, was pleased with the improvement in Argos' sales.\nShares in Home Retail closed down almost 0.5% at 179.1p, but have risen more than 80% this year following Sainsbury's interest in Argos.\nThe supermarket has argued that combining both chains would create a \"world-leading\" retailer bigger than rivals John Lewis and Amazon UK.\nRetail analyst Nick Bubb said: \"Home Retail claim that underlying like-for-like sales were broadly flat, once the cannibalisation from the infamous concession inserts in Homebase and Sainsbury are taken out.

        "document": "Women are as likely as men to ask for a pay rise - but are less likely to get one, the research found.\nThe study, by the Cass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin, looked at 4,600 workers.\nIt found \"no support\" for the \"reticent female\" theory, whereby women avoided asking for more money.\nFor what it claimed was the first time, the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts, by comparing full-time males with full-time females, and part-time males with part-time females.\nWhen like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found.\nThe research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype.\nWhen analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications.\nThe study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so.\nAndrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.\n\"The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.\"\nHe said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women \"were more straightforward and tell their friends\".\n\"Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\" Prof Oswald added.\n\"It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely.\"\nThe study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change.\nDr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: \"The study potentially has an upside. Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior.\"",

        "document": "Yet in this election, it is way down the list of priorities for most political parties.\nPhilip Hammond, himself a former defence secretary, has been reported as saying recently that \"there are no votes in defence\".\nHe does not recognise the quote, but the sentiment is largely borne out by the opinion polls which show defence just scrapes into the top 10 of electorate concerns, way behind the economy, the NHS and immigration.\nUK military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya may have also contributed to a sense of combat fatigue among the public and a reticence by politicians to focus on the subject.\nJames de Waal, a senior fellow at independent think tank Chatham House, says in this campaign, politicians have been \"on the defensive on defence\".\nThis election issue includes foreign policy and the role of UK\u2019s defence forces at home and abroad.\nPolicy guide: Where the parties stand\nTo find out Labour and Conservative policies on the subject you will have to persevere to page 77 of both their manifestos.\nEven then they are pretty short on detail and do not really address the difficult decisions the next government is likely to face.\nSo to help, here is a guide to some of the more sensitive issues being left out.\nMost analysts, and politicians, agree the world is becoming more dangerous and unstable, whether that is shown by thousands of migrants fleeing so-called failed states, the threat from Islamic extremism, or a more belligerent Russia.\nYet at the same time, most European nations, including the UK, have been making significant cuts to their armed forces.\nThe size of the UK's regular Army is being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000.\nYou could fit that number in Wembley Stadium and still have seats to spare.\nThe Royal Navy now has a fleet of just 19 warships, while the RAF has been left with eight - soon to be seven - front-line fast jet squadrons.\nThere are some things the UK military can no longer do - so-called capability gaps.\nThe UK has no Maritime Patrol Aircraft. It has to rely on its Nato allies to hunt for Russian submarines near or in its waters.\nAt the start of the last parliament, David Cameron could boast that the UK was the fourth biggest spender on defence in the world.\nNow, according to the Stockholm International Research Institute, the UK has fallen to sixth place, behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and France.\nA commitment to spend 2% of the nation's wealth, or GDP, on defence is conspicuous by its absence.\nOnly two smaller parties - UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party - say they would continue to meet that goal.\nBut all the indications suggest the UK will soon fall below the Nato threshold.\nMalcolm Chalmers, of the defence think tank Royal United Services Institute, says on current projections, UK defence spending will fall to 1.7% by the end of the decade.\nIf there are more cuts it could fall to 1.5%.\nHe calculates that defence would require another \u00a325bn over the next five years to stay above 2%.\nThe military top brass know that is not going to happen.\nTheir planning assumptions are based on flat spending plus an annual increase of 1% in the equipment budget.\nSpending 2% is not mandatory to Nato membership.\nFew states do, but it is totemic.\nThe US will inevitably think less of a key ally that no longer lives up to that commitment, especially when David Cameron recently lectured others on the need to increase defence spending at the Nato summit in Wales.\nIn US eyes, the UK's credibility will inevitably suffer if, as seems likely, it fails to meet the 2% target.\nIt is more than likely that any future government will have to make more cuts in defence.\nThe question is by how much?\nOver the lifetime of the last parliament, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) cut its budget by about 8%.\nWith the Conservatives, Labour, and the Lib Dems promising to bring down the budget deficit, there will have to be more savings in public spending.\nNone of these three parties say they would ring-fence or protect defence, like the NHS or overseas aid.\nThe MoD has reason to be nervous - it has the second largest non-protected budget, after welfare, of \u00a334bn a year.\nAnother Conservative-led government plans to make savings of around \u00a312bn a year.\nShared across the board that could mean the MoD losing at least another  \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn of its annual budget.\nBut Michael Clark, director of defence think tank Rusi, says most of the political parties appear to be backing away from further big cuts, in part because UKIP has made defence an issue during the campaign.\nThe Conservatives also appear to have limited their options.\nThey are promising to replace Trident, to increase the defence equipment budget by 1% a year, and to make no further cuts to the size of the regular army.\nMr Clark says those commitments will make it hard to find \"significant savings\" in defence.\nBut without raiding the MoD's coffers, he says, the Conservatives' entire fiscal plans would \"go out of the window\".\nLabour has been careful to avoid making similar commitments.\nMilitary chiefs, though, are still worried.\nGen Sir Richard Shirreff, who was the second most senior military commander at Nato, says: \" I fear it's almost certain that there will be more cuts.\"\nThe Conservatives and UKIP are committed to renewing Britain's nuclear deterrent with a like-for-like replacement.\nThat means building four new submarines at an estimated cost of at least \u00a320bn.\nAccording to the MoD's own figures, about one quarter of committed defence equipment spending over the next decade will be on the successor submarines and deterrent systems.\nSo it is an obvious area to look for savings.\nLabour say they would continue the round-the-clock patrols, known as Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD), but will look at whether that can be done with three rather than four submarines.\nThe Liberal Democrats say they would retain a nuclear deterrent, but end CASD - what has been dubbed a \"part-time deterrent\".\nThe SNP and the Greens would scrap it altogether.\nThere is no political consensus.\nJames de Waal, who worked in the MoD on the last Strategic Defence Review says: \"Trident might be up for grabs.\"\nIt is worth remembering the Tories went into the last election committed to renewing Trident, but as part of the coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats, postponed the decision.\nWhat is to prevent another review and another delay, especially if a party like the SNP holds the balance of power?\nPaul Ingram, who heads the British American Security Information Council, says the nuclear programme will have to be included in the next Strategic Defence Review, due after the election.\nNot least because he says the US will find it hard to stomach a key ally spending all that money on the nuclear programme, if it means contemplating further cuts to the UK's conventional forces.\nBy the end of this decade, after a gap of 10 years, the UK will have two new operational aircraft carriers.\nThe Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy.\nThey should be a symbol of power and of global ambition.\nBut there is a danger that they will be more like the emperor's new clothes.\nOn current manning levels, the Royal Navy will struggle to crew both carriers, even if as planned only one of them is operational at any given time.\nPlans to equip them with the new F-35 jet, have already had to be scaled down.\nThere is space on board for 36 F-35s, but current plans are to sail with just 12.\nThe current chief of the defence staff, Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton, has already warned of the dangers of a \"hollow force\" with \"exquisite equipment\" but not enough people.\nPoliticians have long boasted that in military terms Britain can punch above its weight on the world stage.\nBut it's becoming harder to live up to that rhetoric.",

        "document": "In his regular BBC Sport column, football pundit Robbie Savage looks at why Liverpool look a long way off repeating last season's title challenge, how they should line up against Chelsea and the physical and mental battle Steven Gerrard faces to secure a long-term future with the Reds.\nIt is only six months since Steven Gerrard's slip helped the Blues clinch a famous win on Merseyside that derailed Liverpool's title bid.\nBack then, at the end of April, the title was in the Reds' grasp. This weekend, I think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge.\nThey are miles away from the level required for that, and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four.\nIf they manage it, then securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers.\nBut not all their fans see it that way. I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on  606 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick.\nPart of Liverpool's problem is that they overachieved massively last season, which has raised expectations unrealistically. That is not Rodgers' fault.\nWhere he can be questioned is in the transfer market, especially up front.\nBetween them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool's 101 Premier League goals last  season.\nWith Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up.\nBut he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system.\nLooking at Rodgers' options up front for Saturday, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men, and the bottom line is that they are not good enough.\nIt is not just that they do not look like scoring. There is a big difference in their work-rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team.\nThat means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes.\nDoing that in 2013-14 Liverpool scored 59 first-half goals, 13 more than any other team, and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight.\nIn their first 10 games of this campaign, they have only managed a total of four goals before half-time, in three different matches. Instead of being on the front foot, they are having to chase games.\nThey look pedestrian and that is not just the centre-forward's fault.\nWhen I have watched them, no matter what formation they play, they do not seem to have any runners going past their striker from midfield.\nAgain, last season that used to happen all the time, but I was at St James' Park last weekend to  co-commentate on their defeat by Newcastle, and the only player to run beyond Balotelli in the first half was Gerrard, who did it once.\nAnother problem is set-pieces. Liverpool were lethal from them last year, scoring with more than any other top-flight team.\nMore than a third of their goals in 2013-14 came from corners or free-kicks, at a rate of almost one a game. That has dropped off dramatically.\nSadly for Rodgers, seeing the goals drying up is not his only problem.\nLiverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right.\nFrom Mamadou Sakho for \u00a318m in 2013 to Dejan Lovren for \u00a320m this summer, Rodgers has thrown a lot of money at the problem but is still trying to find an answer.\nThey still look all over the place at the back.\nStatistically, they are no worse defensively than last season - but they are also no better.\nLiverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected.\nWhat Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there.\nSimon Mignolet is clearly an excellent shot-stopper but I don't see him coming off his line enough, or commanding his box.\nRodgers tried three at the back against the Magpies, but I cannot see him doing the same against Chelsea.\nHe was criticised for resting players against Real Madrid on Tuesday but I agreed with him for doing it.\nLiverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home.\nNow he has to decide who to play against Chelsea, but whoever he picks, Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement on their recent displays.\nMy team to face Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno, Can, Gerrard, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Borini.\nFor me, Lovren is the big signing who makes way, with Kolo Toure keeping his place after doing well at the Bernabeu.\nIt is a big call to drop Lovren when Rodgers has spent so much money on him, but he has just not been good enough.\nIt is hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet\nHe was poor against Newcastle and has been poor all season.\nAlthough he has got the height that Liverpool will need to defend set-pieces against Chelsea, I saw him get bossed around by Bobby Zamora when Liverpool played QPR at Loftus Road. You have to think that Diego Costa would make mincemeat of him if he is up front for Chelsea.\nTo compete, Liverpool will need a solid four in the middle, with their full-backs looking to join the attack.\nWhether it be Glen Johnson on the right or Alberto Moreno on the left, when one goes forward, then the other should sit back.\nThat way, Liverpool will always have five defensive players to guard against Chelsea's counter-attacks.\nGoing forward, they need their full-backs to contribute in the same way they did last season when they overlapped down the flanks or broke forward with speed.\nThe trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling as attacking midfielders provide pace, trickery and creativity and, leading the line, Borini gives more energy than Lambert or Balotelli.\nHe will have to work hard down the channels to keep Chelsea's defence busy.\nEven if all of that works, however, it is still hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet to every other Premier League team at the moment.\nJose Mourinho's side have not been at their best in the last couple of games but they have not lost any of them either.\nThe only way you would describe their form as disappointing would be in comparison to the way they started the season, when they were electric.\nThe Blues do not seem to have a weakness and, just like in April, I see them leaving Anfield with three points.\nThere is no title on the line this time, but it will still hurt the home fans.\nWhatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished.\nHe was Liverpool's best player against Newcastle and, despite it still being uncertain whether he will get a new Reds contract in the summer, I definitely see him as being part of their longer-term future.\nPlaying in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League. I cannot see him being allowed to leave Anfield but, if he does, he will end up at another top club.\nThe older you get, the harder you have to work, though, and extending his career will be a mental battle as well as a physical one.\nAt 34, he does not have to prove he can ping a ball 60 yards, deliver a great free-kick or make a crunching tackle.\nWhat he has to show is that he can still get about the park well enough to do all of those things effectively.\nBecause, whether he likes it or not, every time he has a bad game he will hear the accusation that \"his legs have gone\".\nOf course he is still fit and can still run. He is probably one of the fittest players at Liverpool. At 36, when I was at Derby, I was still in the top two or three players whenever we did the bleep test.\nWhat happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed Gerrard on the inside\nBut it is the recovery that will test him. When you are flying, you can close someone down, then charge into the next challenge or situation.\nAs you get older, it is harder to get to the next man in time to make a difference. That is what people mean when they say your legs have gone.\nThere is nothing worse as a high-energy midfield player to know that, two or three years ago, you could have made that next challenge - and now you can't.\nI knew it when it happened to me. I would try not to think it but you cannot escape it and it was horrendous. I began to doubt myself and whether anybody would want me to play for them.\nWhat does not help is what other people say. Managers and players told me I was finished but I had to keep believing in myself.\nI knew I was not the player I was, but I still felt I had something to offer.\nFor me, Gerrard undoubtedly does too. Along with Sterling and Sturridge he is still one of Liverpool's most important players.\nOf all the players I faced in my career, he was the one I would have loved to have played with.\nHe was a nightmare to play against because he had everything. At his peak he was the best midfielder the Premier League has seen.\nSaturday will be a difficult occasion for him because what happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed him on the inside.\nOf course he will be thinking about it before the game - he must think about it all the time - but he has not let it stop him.\nIt would have been easy for him to quit after a disappointment like that, but he has kept going like he always does.\nIt is that kind of desire that will keep him going beyond the end of this season too.\nRobbie Savage was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan",

Compensation for such claims is unlimited. \"\nA statement on the agency's website states: \"It is almost politically incorrect to request someone to work for you that is both attractive as well as professionally equipped with the right set of skills.\n\"However, our company understands the importance of having the right people representing your company, because after all, first impressions count.\"\nBut Ms Hilsenrath said: \"Matching Models are right about one thing; first impressions count, but the important stuff is not about your hair colour.\n\"If they wish to maintain their reputation, they should act like a business in the 21st Century and consign this type of sexism to the history books.\"\nUnder the 2010 Equality Act, it is against the law to say, or imply, that you will discriminate against anyone - including saying that you are unable to cater for disabled workers.\nEmployers are also not allowed to question a candidate's age, sexual orientation, marital status, number of children or plans to have children, disability, race or religion.\nAs for specifying clothing sizes, an employer has to be able to show that it is essential to the nature or context of the work.\nTalking about the personal assistant advert, Ms Jansen said: \"The client who wants the specific cup size is an older gentleman - he has a specific outfit he designed with Christian Dior. He wants a \"Jackie O\" look. And he wants a lady with a smaller cup size to fit into the outfit.\"\n\"I recently had an Indian businessman who interviewed 60 women from my firm. He wanted a blonde, blue eyed, Greek woman. He hired 6 of them to work on his plane.\"\nMatching Models clients include MTV, Louis Vuitton, Coca-Cola, the Renualt Formula 1 team and Harrods.\nMs Jansen said she had hired 5,000 people worldwide and pointed out MTV wanted models with tattoos and piercings.",

Those qualities must have been there in the man.\"\nThe portrait was painted by renowned American artist Tim O'Brien, and will be projected onto buildings around the orchestra's home towns of Newcastle and Gateshead over the coming months.\nRegarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, Mozart wrote more than 600 works, including some of the most celebrated and enduring pieces of classical music, before he died at the age of 35.\nOnly 14 images of the composer are known to have been created during his lifetime, but many are stylised or incomplete.\nThe best physical description came from baritone Luigi Bassi, for whom Mozart had written the role of Don Giovanni.\n\"Mr Mozart was an extremely eccentric and absent-minded young man, but not without a certain spirit of pride,\" he said. \"He was very popular with the ladies, in spite of his small size; but he had a most unusual face, and he could cast a spell on any woman with his eyes.\"\nDescribing the existing portraits as \"cosy and pretty\", O'Brien explained the thinking behind his new painting.\n\"I know of few musicians of real depth where you can't see some of that complexity in the face.  So to find the Mozart who was obsessively driven, who pushed boundaries and who lived in a world where harsh poverty and crime were a very real facts, I looked at musicians from our own era to provide some inspiration.\n\"Photos of Johnny Cash and Eric Clapton suggested both obsession and some kind of danger. Johnny Rotten provided a certain precocious brilliance, and I related to those for Mozart.\"\nO'Brien previously made headlines by creating a portrait of Beethoven for the cover of Gramophone magazine, which was inspired by U2 singer Bono.\nThe portrait accompanies the Northern Sinfonia's new season, which includes a series of concerts called Reclaiming Mozart.\nThey begin on Friday, 18 September with the first movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 25, and will also include his Clarinet Concerto and the rarely performed Symphony No. 33.\nMusical director Vogt will be the soloist in the Quintet for Piano and Wind, of which Mozart once wrote: \"I myself consider it to be the best thing I have written in my life.\"\nThe German concert pianist and conductor, who recently played the first night of the Proms, is an avowed Mozart fan - whose desert island disc would be a box set of the composer's works.\nIn his first season as director of the Sinfonia, he plans to stage a number of \"pop-up\" concerts in venues that echo the \"darker corners of Vienna\" that Mozart would have frequented in the 18th Century.",

        "document": "Investing Solutions received those benefit payments over the past two years by finding properties for single homeless men.\nThe charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities.\nNeither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is \"a new low\".\nInvesting Solutions said \"the bulk\" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords.\nThe letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord.\nBoth Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London.\nRecords held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010.\nThe documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\".\nOperating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable.\nIn one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming \u00a32,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants.\nThe owner of the house was getting \u00a31,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of \u00a311,568 on the one property.\nThe company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\".\nBut housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to \u00a3260 per week for each private room.\nOne of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp.\nHe says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable.\nMr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014.\n\"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\"\nNearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than \u00a32.1m.\nThe council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\".\nMatt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\"\nSamir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees.\nHe also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\".\nHe also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\".\nFresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants.\nIt also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions.\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for \"rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing\".",

        "document": "Sunderland's Giaccherini slotted home in the first half after collecting Leonardo Bonucci's superb long pass.\nSouthampton's Pelle sealed the win in injury time with an emphatic volley following an incisive break.\nBelgium were very disappointing, with Romelu Lukaku and Divock Origi wasteful in front of goal.\nEverton forward Lukaku curled over from the edge of the box with just the keeper to beat while Liverpool's Origi missed two opportunities to head his side level.\nBefore the tournament began some pundits condemned this Italy squad for a lack of quality, and even coach Antonio Conte said: \"It isn't a good time for our football.\"\nThe soon-to-be-Chelsea boss added: \"It's important the squad has a good spirit. I work a lot at this.\"\nOn the evidence of this game, that is not the only thing he has worked at.\nItaly's triumph was a result of superior organisation and discipline against 11 Belgian individuals who appear to possess, on paper at least, the greater talent.\nBoth sides now face games against the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, who drew 1-1 in the Group E opener earlier on Monday.\nWith 16 of 24 teams progressing from the group stage, Italy took a huge step towards advancing with victory against their likeliest challengers.\nItaly have won this competition once, in 1968, and finished runners-up twice - most recently in 2012, when they were demolished 4-0 by Spain in the final.\nWhile the current Azzurri side went unbeaten through qualifying, winning seven of their 10 matches, they compare unfavourably with the side of four years ago, lacking the calm, creative brilliance of Andrea Pirlo in midfield and an attacking spearhead to adequately replace a faded Mario Balotelli.\nWhat they do have is a meticulous and tactically astute coach in the Chelsea-bound Conte and a stubborn Juventus-centric defence.\nSuch a foundation allowed them to limit and frustrate Belgium, leaving them vulnerable to one piece of ruthless counter-attacking brilliance - which Bonucci's 50-yard, defence-splitting pass and Giaccherini's cool finish provided.\nThe second half would have been more comfortable for Italy had a second goal been scored from an unmarked position by Pelle, who also had a second header saved by Thibaut Courtois after the break.\nHowever, Conte's imperious rearguard held firm before Pelle volleyed home a neat chipped cross from Antonio Candreva.\nDespite only having qualified for one major tournament in the past 14 years, Belgium came to France as Europe's top-ranked side and one of the favourites to triumph in Paris on 10 July.\nTheir status is built around the attacking potential and club-forged reputation of individuals such as Kevin de Bruyne, Eden Hazard and Lukaku, as opposed to consistent evidence of a cohesive international team.\nHowever, the Red Devils did little to suggest they are ready to convert this promise into something concrete on the big stage.\nThey were pedestrian in the first half, failing to get in behind the Italian backline, with De Bruyne particularly isolated.\nThey upped the speed after the break but still struggled to test Gianluigi Buffon, with Lukaku curling over a good chance and substitute Origi spurning two glorious headed opportunities.\nEqually as worrying for Belgium was the performance of their defence.\nAlready without the injured Vincent Kompany, they looked particularly vulnerable with Jan Vertonghen deployed at left-back instead of alongside his Tottenham colleague Toby Alderweireld in the centre.\nItaly coach Antonio Conte: \"What we demonstrated tonight is that there were two teams who played exciting football, with changes at both ends. It proves that nothing is already written in football, and it is on the field where you have to make your point.\n\"In a tournament like this, you need an alchemy, of people who get on well together and the biggest satisfaction for me tonight is to see how happy they all were, also those on the bench. There's a very good spirit in this squad.\"\nBelgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois: \"Now we have to win the other two matches and be a better team. Italy outclassed us in organisation, and tactically they were the best team.\"\nBBC pundit and former Italy striker Gianluca Vialli: \"I don't want to brag, but we were almost perfect. We dominated the game, we showed desire and commitment and we played like a team. We had a perfect game plan.\"\nBBC pundit and ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand: \"That was a perfect example of one playing like a team, the other like a group of individuals. What was so impressive is the way they can go from defence to attack so quickly.\"\nItaly face Sweden in Toulouse at 14:00 BST on Friday with Belgium taking on the Republic of Ireland in Bordeaux at 14:00 the following day.\nMatch ends, Belgium 0, Italy 2.\nSecond Half ends, Belgium 0, Italy 2.\nGoal!

And all this even before Liverpool's Dejan Lovren rose high at the far post in front of The Kop in injury time to secure a 4-3 victory that will rank alongside the great dramas staged at this sporting theatre.\nIt was played out to the backdrop of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's almost crazed touchline demeanour and the young coach who succeeded him at Borussia Dortmund, the gifted and wonderfully dignified Thomas Tuchel.\nLiverpool moved a step closer to earning a place in the Champions League by winning what some regard as Europe's second-rate pot - not a label anyone was attaching to it after this classic.\nLiverpool into last four after Euro thriller\nIstanbul 2005 win inspired Reds - Klopp\nLiverpool fan to name newborn son Dejan\nWhen Klopp was introduced as Liverpool manager as successor to sacked Brendan Rodgers in October, he revealed one of his priorities was to \"turn doubters into believers\".\nAnd it was the transition from doubt to belief that was at the core of this remarkable Liverpool victory, both on the pitch and in the stands. If there was a trace of doubt this result would not have happened.\nIn nine blistering minutes from the first whistle, this wonderful Borussia Dortmund side simply tore Liverpool apart, with two goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - it was a time for doubts but Klopp delivered inspiration.\nLiverpool needed three goals, leaving Klopp to invoke the spirit of Istanbul and the Champions League Final won from 3-0 down at half-time against AC Milan in 2005, saying: \"Even if it is not likely it is possible, so we should try.\"\nAnd yet this was a mountain Liverpool had to try to climb twice, Divock Origi opened the door but Marco Reus shut it again to leave three goals needed in 33 minutes.\nIt was time for believers, time for that notion Klopp talked about within minutes of walking into Anfield to be acted upon. And it was as Liverpool completed a turnaround that will become a touchstone for the Klopp era with goals from Philippe Coutinho, Mamadou Sakho and the late drama from Lovren.\nBorussia Dortmund possessed class in abundance and that opening phase was jaw-dropping - but Liverpool simply broke them by sheer force of will and a refusal to give up.\nIt takes us back to more words from Klopp. After Liverpool lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace at Anfield in November he was taken aback at supporters leaving early, saying it made him feel alone and adding: \"We decide when it's over.\"\nThis was a phrase that could have been stamped on the foreheads of Liverpool's players on Thursday - a symbol of the Klopp approach that will be at the heart of everything they do.\nIf anyone entered Anfield as a doubter they will have been a confirmed and committed believer by the time they left.\nThis night had a special feel even in the hours before kick-off as Anfield was splashed in colour, the yellow and black flags of Borussia Dortmund facing off against the red and white of Liverpool on The Kop.\nBefore the teams emerged, Anfield was serenaded by arguably the longest version of \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" ever heard at the stadium, Gerry Marsden's voice turned off and Liverpool's supporters taking over, the old anthem returning several times after a brief silence.\nA minute's silence to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 supporters died was perfectly observed, Anfield a cauldron of emotions.\nIt was Liverpool who looked the more nervous side in the opening stages, cut to pieces by high-class opponents who were not intimidated by the searing atmosphere.\nSlowly, after a brief and shocked lull caused by a 2-0 deficit, the sound came back to deafening volume and Borussia were unnerved to the point where their resolve was broken.\nKlopp was a man possessed on the touchline, waving his arms to demand greater encouragement for his players, pointing at his mouth while facing the fans to demand even more noise. It ended up providing a soundtrack to a momentous night.\nTuchel said: \"When Liverpool equalised you noticed the change. There was belief in the stadium and a feeling it was meant to be. Both sets of fans were fantastic and that was one of the best atmospheres ever at a football match.\"\nKlopp added: \"It was brilliant, outstanding, emotional, everything. I will not forget it because it was special. I know this is a place for big football moments. We didn't start these stories but it is now our responsibility to try and write some more nice stories.\"\nThere was certainly a new, unlikely chapter written at Anfield last night.\nIn the afterglow of such sporting brilliance, there was little time for analysis of the nuts and bolts of Liverpool's performance. It was a time to simply reflect on the wonder of what we had witnessed.\nAnd yet, when there is time for reflection, it will reveal much of what is good - and still bad - about Liverpool.\nDivock Origi's goal, his fourth in his past three games, was a piece of composure that confirmed his growing stature and that qualities that persuaded Klopp to pick the 20-year-old ahead of Daniel Sturridge.\nEven as Liverpool battled Dortmund's supremacy, Origi showed power, pace and a willingness to fight. Very much the Klopp template, recalling the words of his manager after his first game in charge at Tottenham six months ago: \"We're going to have a lot of fun with this player.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEmre Can has had a mixed season but was outstanding before picking up an injury, while Coutinho sprinkles the stardust on this Liverpool team.\nIt seems like splitting hairs after such a glorious spectacle, but Liverpool still have a vulnerability at the back that will surely be addressed by Klopp in the summer.\nAlberto Moreno is a weak link at left-back and while Sakho may be a popular figure with supporters, talking of \"a win for the Liverpool country\" and taking selfies on the pitch with Origi, close inspection suggests his positional play was something of an adventure for Dortmund's goals.\nOne thing is clear, however, and qualifies as the biggest plus of all - in the space of six months Klopp has imprinted his identity on his new players and Liverpool's fans. The evidence was all over Anfield.\nMost definitely - indeed many felt the winner of this tie would go on to claim the trophy. It was not a notion welcomed or encouraged by Klopp.\nSevilla, winners for the last two seasons, still lurk after beating Athletic Bilbao on penalties while another Spanish side Villarreal and Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine make up a high-powered last four.\nBut there is almost the spirit of Champions League 2005 about Liverpool's run in the Europa League. Back then Liverpool moved along with no great expectation to not only find themselves in the final but winning it.\nKlopp will guard against any complacency but the way in which Liverpool pulled off an extraordinary feat on Thursday will give them growing confidence that no task is too onerous for them at Anfield in the semi-finals.\nThe Europa League is not the only prize within reach - a return to the Champions League via victory in this tournament is now tantalisingly coming into view.\nThe famous \"This Is Anfield\" sign has greeted players on the path to the pitch for decades - many touch it for luck and Klopp even did so himself on a visit to the stadium for a friendly when coach of Borussia Dortmund.\nIt carries an aura but Klopp has put a banning order on his players, saying: \"I've told my players you need to win something before you touch the 'This Is Anfield'. It's a sign of respect. You don't do it - it is too big.\"\nKlopp has delivered another incentive to his Liverpool charges.",

He timed his effort well there.\n\"We hardly saw him in the race, he monitored things but that's why. He was waiting for that final sprint. And what a ride that was for him.\n\"But with three laps to go, I would not have said that Teklinski would make it, but he found something from somewhere to just hang on there.\n\"More than 2km out, he effectively started to sprint. It will take him some time to recover from that.\"\nSix-time Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy\n\"I don't think that would be expected. It's the kind of event you can never be super-confident of winning or winning a medal in.\n\"But if you ride sensibly, which he did, he positioned himself very well and didn't waste any energy in the first part of the race.\n\"He marked the danger men and clearly had the legs for the sprint at the end. That's fantastic, a really great result for him and the team.\"\nTeam pursuit Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker came into the quartet of Emily Nelson, Manon Lloyd and Ellie Dickinson.\nThe young squad were unable to compete for a medal but Barker remained positive about their progress.\nShe told the BBC: \"It's the first Worlds for all of these girls and it's made it a lot more exciting.\n\"The level is so high already physically and technically. We have so much scope for improvement. It's such a good place to be in.\n\"Four years until Tokyo and we've just come fifth at the Worlds.\"\nDouble Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell Shand said on BBC TV: \"Coming into the competition, I don't think anyone expected them to medal.\n\"Until Elinor Barker joined the team today, we had four brand new riders. With an average age of 19, they've all got bright futures ahead of them.\"\nEarlier in the day, Olympic bronze medallist Katy Marchant was eliminated from the women's sprint in the first round.\nThe 24-year-old, who claimed bronze behind Kristina Vogel of Germany and fellow Briton Becky James at Rio 2016, was the only female sprinter to travel to Hong Kong.\nThe former heptathlete qualified in 16th place but was ousted by 17th-fastest Lin Junhong of China earlier on Thursday.\nMarchant is scheduled to compete in two more events - Saturday's 500m time-trial and Sunday's keirin.\n\"I'm really disappointed. I feel like I'm just missing a little bit of zing, which is something that coming off Rio is to be expected,\" she said.\n\"I didn't get the roar when I got the number on my back today - maybe the fact it's not an Olympic Games or something in the back of my mind telling me that I'm not feeling great.\n\"I know to get knocked out in the first round is not what we expect from a medallist, but the preparation coming into this competition is about the process leading on to Tokyo.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device",

They hope it will safeguard his legacy.\nBilly Bilsland, Brian Smith and David Lang are respected figures in the Scottish cycling scene.\nMillar was a pupil of Bilsland's at his circuit training classes in Glasgow in the late 1970s.\nA veteran of the professional continental racing circuit, Bilsland and fellow Glasgow Wheelers stalwart Arthur Campbell helped nurture the fiercely ambitious Millar and set him on his way to France.\nSmith, now manager of the Endura racing team, trained with Millar when his hero returned home from racing across mainland Europe.\nHe picked up the Scots pro baton that was handed from Bilsland to Millar and raced in the same Motorola team as Lance Armstrong.\nHe is a trusted friend of the enigmatic Scot - and a cycling nut.\n\"Didn't I see you win the Glasgow-Dunoon race in the '80s?\" I wondered.\nSmith, from Paisley and now based in Kent, replied that he had indeed won, aged 18 and at his first attempt - and he could even remember the gear combination he used in the final 25-mile section.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLang, who captains Millar's former club, the Glasgow Wheelers, said: \"In my opinion, he is definitely the best stage rider that Britain has ever produced.\n\"Yet I'm sure if you stopped most people in the street and asked them who Robert Millar is, most Glaswegians wouldn't know.\n\"So we looked at the possibility of setting up a sportive in Robert's honour.\n\"He did a lot of his training over the Crow Road, between Lennoxtown and Fintry, and that is the final climb.\n\"The circuit also goes over the Tak Me Doon from Kilsyth, which is tough as well.\"\nMillar's steely determination and aggressive climbing skills saw him finish fourth in the 1984 Tour de France, as well as securing second places in the Tours of Spain (twice) and Italy.\nAnd then there were apparent contradictions: self-deprecating and shy or self-assured; pony-tailed waif or tough as teak; proud of his roots or occasionally dismissive - \"the Caledonian antisyzygy\" on two wheels.\nLang put it thus: \"Robert was very much a loner. He was determined to be a world-class cyclist and it didn't really matter who he upset to get there.\"\nBilsland, to whom Millar gifted his 1984 King of the Mountains polka dot jersey which now hangs on the wall of his bike shop, added: \"Robert was special.\n\"He was focused on what he was about. He believed in himself. When he attacked, he attacked to win.\n\"I think he was one of the few Scotsmen who ever got their photograph on the front cover of L'Equipe.\n\"I believe if he had the backing of the Sky team now, he would have won the Tour.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"When he was with Peugeot, a lot of the French guys didn't want to ride for him. A lot of the victories he got on his own merit.\"\nThe sportive, Lang believes, is the first time Millar has allowed his name to be used for a cycling event.\nThe intensely private Millar gave his permission to Smith as long as proceeds went to the Glasgow Wheelers' development squad for young riders and the Braveheart Fund, which Smith established a decade ago to improve young Scottish cyclists' prospects.\n\"He was one of my idols,\" said Smith. \"He used to come back in the winter to Glasgow. Every year he came round to the house and gave me a jersey.\n\"I was fortunate then; I was just as small as him so I could use them.\n\"And now, to have a Robert Millar Sportive is fantastic because the legacy of the name will go on.\n\"Every hill that you go over will remind you how difficult it was to become King of the Mountains in the biggest annual sporting event in the world.\"",

        "document": "Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday.\nFor decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers.\nEx-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a \"very, very important place\" through which most of the public received its information.\nThe first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702.\nAt its height, \"the Street of Shame\" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius.\nMr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years.\nHe is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats.\nAlthough the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides.\n\"I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here.\n\"I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'.\"\nThe street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women.\nHe says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff.\n\"There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying.\"\nMr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about.\n\"The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time.\"\nHis memories of the street in its heyday are of \"watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers\".\n\"Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago.\"\nMr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of \"certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then\".\nFollowing their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs.\nRobin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail.\n\"At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,\" he says.\n\"The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards.\"\nLiz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there.\n\"Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street.\n\"But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street.\n\"When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one.\n\"Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm.\n\"The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street.\n\"At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool.\n\"I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him.\n\"He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'\"\nBut, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble.\nMedia tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions.\nBy 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards.\nAs a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the \"Stab in the Back\" is a Pizza Express.\nNow a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline.\n\"As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me,\" says Mr Smith.\n\"It makes me smile, when I think of how I now have that place in history.\"",

        "document": "The claims against the agricultural commodities trader were made in a report by Mighty, a US-based environmental lobby group.\nMighty also accuses Olam and its main stakeholder, Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek, of turning a blind eye to these practices.\nBoth companies reject the allegations.\nSingapore and Malaysia regularly suffer from haze caused by slash-and-burn practices by small-scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia.\nIndonesia is often blamed for not doing enough to tackle the agriculture fires used to clear vegetation for palm oil, pulp and paper plantations in the Riau province in East Sumatra, South Sumatra, and parts of Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo.\nSingapore-based Olam has confirmed that it buys 99% of its palm oil from third party suppliers and while it is a relative newcomer to the industry, it says it accounts for less than 1% of the global market.\nMighty's report says Olam and Temask could be unwittingly encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires.\nIt also says Olam created a \"secretive market for rogue palm oil companies\" that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources.\nBut Olam chief executive Sunny Verghese told the BBC that the firm had a \"very vigorous sourcing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning, so it's a 'no burn-no peat-no deforestation' compliance policy\".\nThe company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on Monday, having previously resisted calls by Mighty to do so.\nMr Verghese said he believed the firm's current suppliers all met Olam's strict requirements, but added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete.\nHe added that producers who do not comply with the company's sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain.\nSince Temasek is the majority stake holder in Olam, Mighty's allegations could link Singapore's state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia - if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven.\nTemasek's investment in Olam means that \"the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world's black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze,\" the report says.\nTemasek has dismissed the allegations, explaining that they \"fully support no-burn policies for land clearance, and would urge oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same.\"\nThe fund told the BBC: \"Olam's operations are properly matters for the board and management of Olam to address.\n\"As a matter of proper governance, Temasek does not direct the business operations of our portfolio companies, including Olam.\"\nIt would be fair to say that the palm oil industry globally has a troubled track record.\nIt is one of the world's biggest industries, projected to be worth $88bn by 2022 but also often accused of unfair and illegal labour practices, as well as deforestation and the burning of plantations.\nGreen groups and palm oil executives often find themselves at loggerheads with one another - NGOs say that the industry is wilfully turning a blind eye to environmentally unfriendly practices, while palm oil executives claim it is an industry-wide problem, and policing third party suppliers is impossible.\nActivists say governments need to punish palm oil firms that don't comply with acceptable standards of protecting the environment - but changing the government mindset can be challenging, because the reality is many of these firms bring jobs and investment to rural areas.\nThe report also highlights concerns in the African state of Gabon, where according to Mighty, Olam \"bulldozes rainforests to establish monoculture palm oil plantations,\" bringing the same practices to Africa \"that have destroyed vast natural landscapes in Southeast Asia\".\nIn response to the accusation that Olam is responsible for vast forest clearings through its joint ventures with the government of Gabon, Olam said its private-public partnerships in the country strove to be both responsible and transparent.\n\"We agree with Gabon's sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done,\" it said.\n\"Our plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparently with stakeholders and put in the public domain.\"",

Wales' foundation industries have witnessed a steep decline.\"\nHe said UK government should also work with the EU to ensure maximum flexibility in use of procurement legislation so that they can better protect British industry.\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"No-one has defended the steel industry more than the Welsh government.\n\"We have raised with the UK government over several years our concerns about the impact high UK energy prices are having on the competitiveness of our industries and again call on them to address this major problem.\n\"The economy minister has set-up an industry-led task group to gather examples of good procurement practices and to identify support other EU countries have provided to their steel industries.\"\nPro Steel Engineering in Caldicot, Monmouthshire, is only three years old but has benefited from contracts in London, including the new Olympic Stadium roof in London for West Ham United and strengthening the Hammersmith fly-over.\nDirector Richard Selby said: \"We're fortunate we're expanding and are hoping to start recruiting in a couple of months and we have a full order book.\n\"We've had the ability to stay agile and seizing the opportunities.\n\"But the foundation industries need a lot more support, particularly with the energy costs we have, and we need for the Welsh government and Westminster to get behind them to help them thrive.\"\nEconomist Prof Calvin Jones, of Cardiff University, said the foundation industries were still important in terms of their high economic value and for being iconic.\nBut he said Wales' growth areas had been in retail, hotels, back-office financial services and the public sector.\n\"We have to think about how they will fulfil Wales' economic destiny as we'd like to see it,\" he said.\n\"Of course, on current structures they can't, they simply aren't like Tata which is a company which is incredibly valuable in so many ways.\n\"A back office for a bank simply can't do the same things for Wales, no matter how many bums on seats there are in those call centres. They don't provide the same jobs or a narrative for the Welsh economy that will give us a future vision.\"\nProf Jones said the steel industry in Wales had done relatively well to avoid the worst of the crisis so far.\n\"There have been big rounds of redundancies over the last 30 years and we've a very lean operation in Wales and geographically we're better placed than those steelworks in the north of England and Scotland.\"",

        "document": "Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients.\nCommandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting.\nThe so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack.\nThe Taliban has denied any involvement.\nMore than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said.\nWorld powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game'\nHow successful has IS been in Afghanistan?\nStuck between IS and the Taliban\nPresident Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital \"trampled all human values\".\n\"In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,\" he said.\nThe attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker \"wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors\".\nOne employee wrote on Facebook: \"Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us.\"\nThe hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital.\nPreviously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month.\nBut at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks.\nIf that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months.\nIn the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks.\nThe government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control.\nTV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building.\nMore than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead.\nThe IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies.\nAfghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to \"avenge the blood of our people\".\nIS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks.\nIn July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people.\nThree months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30.\nIS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nThe Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.",

I guess we'll have to put up with their telephone reminders.\"\nElena and her husband owe well over 1m roubles (about \u00a310,800; $17,000) to those four banks.\nAfter the cash piles are sorted the family of three is left with only 10,000 roubles (\u00a3107; $167). That puts them below the poverty line - and recently Elena lost her job.\nMillions of those in debt live like Elena.\nAccording to the Russian United Credit Bureau (UCB), 40 million Russians have loans or mortgages.\nBy June, 12.5m of those loans had not been paid for at least a month, and in another 8m cases the arrears stretched back over three months.\nThe Russian Central Bank says total personal debt has risen to 1tn roubles (\u00a310.7bn; $16.7bn). At least 10% of that amount cannot be recovered by the banks.\nFor Elena and her husband, this is a story of almost two decades of borrowing. They started getting loans in the mid-1990s to pay for their daughter's medical treatment. Then they took a bigger loan to pay off the smaller ones.\nIt all seemed manageable, says Elena, but then new expenses came along - and two banks offered credit cards with generous conditions.\n\"We were a bit stupid,\" Elena says. \"They told us the minimum payment was 5,000 roubles a month and we paid that every month. But that was just the interest, not the loan itself.\"\nDuring Russia's boom years credit history checks meant virtually nothing. An individual already saddled with loans could take out another one, hoping to pay off previous debts. The small print was often too small to bother about.\nThen the music stopped. Money got tight after the 2008 global financial crisis and Western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict.\nThe average personal loan in 2014 was 54,600 roubles.\nOlga Mazurova is head of Sentinel Credit Management, one of Russia's largest debt-collecting agencies. She says that often Russians are hit by a sudden drop in income, because \"the firm goes bankrupt, the working week is cut, there are layoffs or wage cuts - we see that especially in industrial cities in Siberia and the Urals\". Few Russians have insurance for such contingencies, she says.\nDebtors cannot get much help. There are plans to amend the law on insolvency, to allow individuals to be declared bankrupt. But nothing will happen on that until October.\nRussian MPs decided that criminal courts were unprepared for the likely flood of such cases and that courts of arbitration should handle debt cases instead.\nEach debtor has to beg the bank to cut them some slack. But Russia's financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev says that rarely works if someone owes money to more than one institution.\nA former adviser to President Vladimir Putin, he knows many top Russian financiers personally - but that does not help him to lobby on behalf of indebted callers. Typically, he says, lenders refuse to restructure personal debts with the words: \"I've got a business to run and shareholders demand profits - I can't do it!\"\nMr Medvedev says his success rate in helping debtors has dropped from 51% to 33% and \"this year it's probably going to be around 16%\".\nHe had no solution for one caller, Vladimir Frolov, living near Moscow.\nMr Frolov started borrowing four years ago to help his partner, living separately from him, in Ukraine. The debts snowballed. Finally, unable to get an unsecured loan, he mortgaged the flat he shares with his elderly parents.\nHis father Anatoly, who co-signed the agreement, is bewildered when asked which bank it was. \"How should I know? They took us into some room, the light was dim and the print was tiny. I just asked if everything was alright and they told me it was.\"\nBesides the mortgage, Vladimir Frolov's parents took out two loans to help him, which eat up 18,000 of their 22,000-rouble monthly pension allowance.\nAnd now Vladimir has defaulted on the mortgage. The bank is suing and they may well lose their only dwelling.\n\"There must be a normal way out - maybe give the bank a fixed share of my wages?\" Vladimir wonders. But so far he has not found anyone at the bank to discuss his dilemma.\n\"Isn't there a law against this?\" asks his father, equally helplessly. \"How can they let people borrow so much without checking them first?\"\nAfter the good years many Russians are now getting a harsh lesson in capitalism - and inadequate regulations mean there is nothing to soften the blow.",

This needs to be a long-term budget.\n\"Scotland needs a government that spends less time congratulating itself on its spin and more time explaining its record.\n\"Scottish Labour will offer a real alternative to austerity, with different decisions on tax to the Tories, and different decisions on tax to the SNP.\"",

One third of the \u00a318bn cost is being provided by Chinese investors.\nHours after EDF's board voted to approve the \u00a318bn power plant on Thursday, the government launched a further review of the project.\nThis stunning new development came all the way from the top of government and the timing seemed calculated to cause maximum impact.\nEDF executives were taken completely off guard, the post-Brexit run of major investment is abruptly halted and what precious entente cordiale in Anglo-French relations there is left after the EU referendum result seems diminished.\nIs it a genuine pause for a new government to read the small print of a project that is two administrations old, or a signal of a potential change in policy?\nSimon Jack: Hinkley delay is a high stakes bet\nTom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, urged the government to make a decision as soon as possible.\n\"We need to get on and do this and that's why I'm hoping the government make their decision very soon because if it goes on for a lengthy period of time we are going to run the risk of having real problems in terms of our energy supplies,\" he said.\n\"Then what happens is that we end up paying a lot more and we end up paying for much more dirty power which we can't afford to do if we are to meet our climate commitments.\"\nClaire Jacobson, head of climate, energy and environment policy at the EEF manufacturers' organisation said the government's decision was \"yet another blow to a decision that has been hindered by many delays and uncertainties\".\nHinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement.\nAnnouncing the approval of investment on Thursday, EDF had described the plant as \"a unique asset for French and British industries\", saying it would benefit the nuclear sectors in both countries and would give a boost to employment.\nHowever, the project has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity.\nDespite the Chinese investment, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company, which has had to raise money from its owners.\nEarlier this week, EDF shareholders approved plans to issue new shares to raise \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.4bn) to help pay for the project.\nAhead of Thursday's vote on whether to approve the project, an EDF board member, Gerard Magnin, resigned, saying the project was \"very risky\" financially.\nEarlier this year, EDF's finance director, Thomas Piquemal, had resigned amid reports he thought Hinkley could damage EDF itself.\n5,600\nworkers on site at peak\n4,000km electrical cabling\n230,000 tonnes of steel\n5.6m cubic metres of earth to be moved\nEnvironmentalists are also concerned about the plan. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: \"Countless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money.\nHe added that EDF's decision to go ahead with the investment, \"doesn't prove the UK is open for business post-Brexit - it just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians\".\nThe campaign group added that more investment was needed for renewable energy such as offshore wind.\nJan 2006 - Government proposes nuclear as part of future energy mix\nMar 2013 - Construction of Hinkley Point approved\nOct 2013 - UK government agrees \u00a392.50 per megawatt-hour will be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site - around double the current market rate at the time\nOct 2015 - EDF signs investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN)\nJuly 2016 - EDF board approves final investment decision, but the UK Government postpones a final decision on the project until autumn.",

She's a clone. One of a flock of 13 cloned sheep currently living out their lives on a farm owned by the University of Nottingham, and one of only four (the others are Debbie, Denise and Diane) cloned from the same adult ewe as Dolly the sheep - the first cloned mammal born in 1996.\nThis, despite the passage of a couple of generations in sheep-years, says Kevin Sinclair, professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study, makes them Dolly's - and that original ewe's - identical twin sisters.\n\"Where there was one Dolly, with these four girls, now there are five,\" he says.\nWe're standing in a straw-lined pen in a barn on the university's Sutton Bonington Campus and one-by-one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of exacting, methodical tests.\nAs far as I can tell it's a process the sheep seem well used to. If not exactly enthusiastic, they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation.\nBut if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention, that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world.\nAccording to Prof Sinclair, the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results.\nHe tells me: \"One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly, and all the cloning work that has gone on since, is: do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they?\"\nUnderpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process. Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some \"age-memory\" might be transferred into the next generation.\n\"That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect,\" says Prof Sinclair.\n\"A new born clone might look like a lamb, but in terms of cellular senescence it would be much older, and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age.\"\nThe original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-and-a-half. Along with several other members of her flock she had contracted a virus that caused lesions to develop in her lungs and she had to be put down.\nBut by then Dolly was already suffering from osteoarthritis which, although not unheard of in a sheep of her age, did raise concerns about premature aging. The decision was taken to go back to the original cell line and to produce more clones.\n\"We wanted to know if Dolly's untimely death was just unlucky\", recalled Prof Sinclair, \"or if it was something to do with the cloning process itself. If illnesses like arthritis that are associated with old age were more common in cloned animals.\"\nGetting the answers to those questions has involved putting the dollies, and nine other sheep cloned from different cell lines, through an exhaustive battery of tests and assessments including regular joint X-rays and a series of full-body fMRI scans.\nProf Sinclair said: \"We focused on three co-morbidities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoarthritis - the three co-morbidities most associated with aging. Were these animals any different from the wider population of sheep with regard to these particular co-morbidities.\"\nThe results of the study, which could have profound implications for the future of cloning, will be published next week. But for now, the dollies, which are approaching their ninth and tenth birthdays, seem to be in rude health.\nFollow Tom on Twitter.",

The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\nThe Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\".\nIsrael rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state.\nMr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister.\nThe Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot.\nBut on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed.\nMr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech.\n\"It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" he said.\n\"We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.\"\nMr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as \"misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government.\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution \"paves the way\" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January.\n\"We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,\" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.",

        "document": "They range from extra responsibility for off-street parking, through to tourism.\nPotentially, though, the most controversial move will be putting politicians in charge of all but the most significant planning decisions.\nCouncils will be able to accept or reject developments in their own areas.\nCurrently, if you want to build a new house or erect an extension, you have to apply for permission to the Planning Service, an agency that comes under the umbrella of Stormont's environment department.\nPlanning officials refer your application to your local council. The councillors can express their opinion on the merits of your application, but the final say rests with the Planning Service.\nFrom April 2015 that responsibility will shift to the councils themselves, meaning elected politicians will make planning decisions.\nSo is this a positive move, democratising our planning system?\nMichael Corr, the creative director of Northern Ireland's architecture and planning centre, PLACE, is optimistic.\nMr Corr already works with councils and government departments, providing advice on new developments like leisure centres.\nHe told me the move is \"a huge opportunity for the future, which offers local councils an opportunity to develop their own community and development plans\".\nBut do Northern Ireland's politicians have the necessary skills?\nSpeaking about voters, Mr Corr said: \"They really want to choose politicians who have the ability and understand urban regeneration and planning issues, because it's those politicians who will be able to make the biggest difference.\"\nHowever, not everyone is so upbeat.\nBack in the 1960s, local councils in Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing.\nProtests, like the one against Dungannon council's allocation of housing in County Tyrone, fuelled the Civil Rights movement.\nThe environmental group Friends of the Earth warn that a strict code of conduct will have to be rigorously enforced in order to ensure the new councils' handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent.\nJames Orr, Northern Ireland director for Friends of the Earth, said: \"In terms of property deals and in terms of politicking, we could see a situation not too far away from what happened in the 1960s, where certain communities get planning permission more favourably than other communities.\"\nMr Orr is also concerned about what he describes as a \"tradition of close relationships between developers and political parties here\".\nHe said: \"It's quite easy to see that continuing, where we get a laissez-faire system which says, 'you look after your community and we won't bother engaging in proper democratic planning' . That is a real danger and that's why we need the nuts and bolts of good transparency put in place.\"\nFriends of the Earth argue that giving politicians more powers with real financial consequences for developers and objectors makes it increasingly important that the public should know who donates to Northern Ireland's political parties.\nSome local politicians remain opposed to the move, because they say it could deter donors worried about their personal security.\nOthers argue that the \u00c2\u00a37,500 limit for declaring donations is largely irrelevant to Northern Ireland, as the Stormont parties don't attract such large amounts.\nUnder the terms of a law passed earlier this year, it's up to the Northern Ireland Secretary to decide when the time is right to make an order shedding more light on political donations.",

This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy.\nA further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks.\nThese events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation.\nRancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it. The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years.\nIn September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy. It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history.\nIn 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties. Following the elections the Commonwealth re-instated Fiji as a member.\nFiji's population, which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India.\nThe two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-2000s, by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee. Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority.\nMixing between the two groups is minimal, and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society.\nThere are also very small non-Indo-Fijian, non-Fijian minority communities, such as Chinese and Rotumans.\nAlthough the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange, its economy is diverse. Gold, silver and limestone are mined, and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing.\nNonetheless, Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, making it one of the world's largest per capita recipients of aid.",

He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things \"in perspective\".\nTillerson had previously said the US should \"maintain its seat at the table\" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation's top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement.\nBut publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal. It seems the president's daughter, Ivanka, took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers. And the role of super-engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration, Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony.\nMr Tillerson did not attend, whether out of resignation or as an everyday-act-of-resistance, we don't know. A State Department official said only that he was in his office and \"maintained his schedule, preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand\".\nNo doubt Pruitt (and his ally, White House adviser Steve Bannon) had an easier task than Tillerson, given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments.\nBut the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state. He's already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department. And the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has even less diplomatic experience than he does, has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House.\nClearly, the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department, which has yet to issue a statement.\nWhere it once straddled the front lines of global climate negotiations, it's now been dropped off the map.\nThe US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues, the UNFCCC, but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement.\nFinally, it's a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck.\n\"We have now slapped every country in the world in the face,\" says Todd Stern, the US Special Envoy for Climate Change in the Obama administration.\n\"We've said we know this matters to you a lot, we know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world, we know that some of you are particularly vulnerable, but we drop out. It's the worst way you could treat other countries.\"\nTo be fair, this is not entirely untravelled ground - remember George W Bush's decision against ratifying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty.\nBut it is more starkly isolationist, and this is a different Washington - in private chats, international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still unstaffed. They struggle to find the people who can listen to their concerns or tell them what's going on.\nSo while this will not break alliances, it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends.\nFollow Barbara on Twitter",

        "document": "The latest intake of Tory MPs is far and away the most Eurosceptic in the Conservative Party's history.\nAlmost all of the pro-European \"big beasts\" of the Thatcher/Major years - men like Chris Patten and Michael Heseltine - are long gone from front-line politics.\nAccording to Tim Montgomerie, the assiduous student of backbench opinion who writes for the website Conservative Home, a third of those now on the Conservative benches would like to see a fundamental renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Europe, and another third would like Britain to come out altogether.\nThe estimate of more than a hundred outright \"withdrawalists\" - Conservatives who essentially believe in the European policy of the UK Independence Party - suggests many Tory MPs are being coy about what they really believe.\nOnly ten Conservative MPs have declared their position publicly, by joining the \"Better Off Out\" group, which campaigns openly for withdrawal.\nToday Euroscepticism is the iceberg of Tory politics; only the top is visible, but a large and - for the leadership - possibly dangerous mass lies beneath the water.\nThat impression is reinforced by the fact that two of the MPs I interviewed for BBC Radio 4's Analysis would talk only on condition we concealed their identity.\nOne of them told me that even though his views are, he believes, now \"mainstream\" in his party, he still sees support for EU withdrawal in Wildean terms as \"the love that dare not speak its name\".\nThe other complained of a \"supine approach\" to Europe by the Party's leadership since it came into government.\nWhen the Conservatives were in opposition, David Cameron made a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that, should he be elected Prime Minister, he would hold a referendum on any EU Treaty that emerged, as \"no treaty should be ratified without consulting the British people in a referendum\".\nThe Lisbon treaty was ratified by all EU states before the 2010 general election, but critics maintain that David Cameron reneged on his promise.\n\"The collateral damage from that broken promise\", our un-nameable MP said, \"is a bit of a black cloud over the government even now\".\nCould the government ship be heading towards a collision with the Eurosceptic iceberg?\nThere are signs of new currents of opinion on Europe swirling through the left of British politics too.\nLast year, during the Labour leadership campaign, Ed Balls questioned one of the principles at the heart of the EU and its single market, the free movement of labour.\nMr Balls, now shadow chancellor, said he wanted to stop \"the practice where people can work in our country and send benefits back to their own countries\".\nThat theme has been picked up by Lord Glasman, the driving force behind the Blue Labour movement - which aims to revitalise the party's traditional grassroots support - and an influential adviser to the Labour leader Ed Miliband.\nMaurice Glasman argues against the current EU rules which, he says, encourage people in poorer member states to leave their families to work overseas, arguing the practice can depress workers' incomes in richer economies.\nHe told Analysis he would be happy to make common cause with Tory Eurosceptics if he concluded it would advance his cause.\nAll these factors suggest that Europe could soon occupy centre stage in British politics once again.\nAnd the crisis in the eurozone has offered a golden opportunity to those pushing the government to engage in debate about Europe.\nDouglas Carswell, Tory backbench MP for Clacton in Essex, and one of the small group of Better Off Out MPs, argues that the eurozone crisis has destroyed the economic case for EU membership:\n\"Far from joining a prosperous trading bloc\", he says, \"we shackled ourselves to a corpse. We are now actually having to pay to prop up a zombie currency we didn't even join.\"\nBut Mr Carswell appears to be in a minority - not so much in his views, as in his enthusiasm for making Europe a salient issue at this stage of the current parliament.\nTory memories of the bitter divisions of the past over Europe are still raw.\nThere is also a widespread recognition among Eurosceptic Tories that economic recovery, not Europe, must be the government's priority.\n\"So long as Britain is in an economic crisis\", says Tim Montgomerie, \"every Conservative MP knows that the focus must be on fixing that, and staying in coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a government of national unity.\"\nAnalysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST\nDownload the Analysis podcast\nListen via the Radio 4 website\nFollow Analysis on Facebook\nLast month a group of more than a hundred Conservative MPs met in the Thatcher Room of the House of Commons to debate a European strategy.\nThe meeting's convener, the young MP for Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, and former Cameron aide George Eustice, said the group would be looking for \"new thinking\" on Europe, not campaigning for a referendum on British withdrawal.\nOne of those who attended the meeting, Clare Perry, a prominent member of the new intake of Tory MPs, described \"this in-or-out discussion\" as \"a bit crude\", and said she thinks the choice is between \"the status quo or a renegotiation of the relationship\".\nThe wildest card of all is what happens in Europe itself.\nAlmost everyone now agrees that fundamental reform of the Eurozone is inevitable - whether the Euro survives as a currency or breaks apart.\nThat in turn is bound to have an impact on Britain's relationship with the Eurozone countries, and may well force changes in the way the wider EU works.\nFormer Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont told Analysis that if the Eurozone countries form a tighter fiscal union, Britain might simply \"wave goodbye\" altogether.\nAnd Mark Seddon, a Labour Party activist who runs the People's Pledge campaign for a referendum on EU membership, believes the sort of changes that are likely to come will force the government to put the matter to the public.\nIt is exhilaratingly uncharted territory, and the choices to be made will probably not become clear until much closer to the next election in 2015.\nThose MPs who are so nervous about debating Europe now, may find that by the time they are ready to come out, the terms of the debate have changed beyond all recognition.\nAnalysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October at 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST.

        "document": "Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers.\nThe best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International.\nAll three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups.\nThe most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin.\nMost recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions.\n\"I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,\" he urged readers on Facebook.\nVolunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine.\nThe Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.\n\"DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,\" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests.\nTo disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney.\nThe Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware.\nOn 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nSome media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire.\nBut officials deny this. \"We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC.\nOn the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych.\nThe group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the \"genocide\" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is \"We won't forgive or forget\", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media.\nDuring US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: \"Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.\"\nCyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine.\nAnother stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists \"war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict.\nThey also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website.\nIn addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.\nThe claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified.\nRussian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as \"Humpty Dumpty\".\nWhat is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders.\nThe group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine.\nIn  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces.\nAnd in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.\nAccess to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

There are only two other First Ladies in the history of the United States who have not made the White House their home during their husbands' years as commander-in-chief: Martha Washington, because it had yet to be built, and Anna Harrison, because her husband died before she could take up residence.\nBut Mrs Trump's decision has its supporters.\n\"Good, this is what most responsible parents do with a child Barron's age,\" one Twitter user noted.\nHowever, it is not out of character for Mrs Trump, who has repeatedly stressed that Barron, 10, is her focus - staying at home during the campaign to care for him in Trump Towers.\nBut they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House. So how have families coped before?\nWilliam Seale, a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President's House, said President Grover Cleveland's wife, Frances Folsom Cleveland, only lived in the White House during social season.\nThe president bought a house during his first term, where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time. The first lady referred to the first home as \"Oak View\" but it was more commonly known as \"Red Top\" because of its red roof.\nBut the young bride, who was age 21 when she married the 49-year-old president, was the only first lady to be married in the White House.\n\"The concern of children staying back to finish school - that's more typical than not,\" Mr Seale said.\n\"It seems not very unusual to me that she would want the child to finish this year of school. I don't find it very surprising.\"\nMr Seale noted that the children of President John Tyler, who became president after William Henry Harrison's death, were not immediately moved to the White House.\nJames Madison's wife, Dolley Madison, also sent her son from her first marriage, Payne Todd, away to school.\nThere have been two sets of school age children living in the White House in the past three decades: Chelsea Clinton, who was 12 at the time, and Malia and Sasha Obama, who were 10 and seven respectively.\nThey also had to move across the country when their fathers became president - but all three lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue from the day of the inauguration.\nIn fact, the Obamas avoided the problem of the girls having to change school mid-term by moving to Washington early, allowing them to start a new school a few weeks before Dad was inaugurated in January 2009.\nRead more: Why Obama may not go quietly\nMrs Trump has indicated Barron will be her top priority, with everything else coming second. Reading between the lines, it suggests she will not be taking on the full-time role predecessors like Mrs Obama have.\nOfficially, the role of the first lady is only ceremonial - she is supposed to be the White House's hostess, organising and attending functions with or without their spouses.\nIn more recent times, they have also sought out causes to support and promote. Mrs Obama has used her time backing a number of initiatives and projects, including Let Girls Learn, that aims to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school.\nThe first lady occupies a very public role, according to Mr Seale.\n\"It gives a kind of personal side to the White House. It might even be considered vital to the public's perception of the president,\" he said. \"[The president] is an administrator and a he is a symbol and I think the first lady's role is very important to that symbol part.\"\nLou Henry Hoover, wife to President Herbert Hoover, was the first president's wife to really take on an active public role, Mr Seale said.\nHer immediate successor, Eleanor Roosevelt, also served as a more visible first lady in her husband's administration.\nOne notable first lady who was reluctant to step into the public role was Nancy Reagan, according to Mr Seale.\nMrs Reagan, who had a big influence on her husband's presidency and would later become known for her anti-drug campaign, was at first only focused on being a supportive wife.\n\"Her big interest in the world was her husband,\" Mr Seale said, adding that she was a very private person.\nAs to what Melania's priorities will be there is only one hint - she is interested in tackling cyber-bullying.\nRead more: Taking to the streets for women's issues\nIt has happened in the past. However, not when the president's wife has still been alive.\nThomas Jefferson's daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph took the role in 1801, while Angelica van Buren took up the duties of a first lady after marrying President Martin van Buren's son in 1838. Both men had lost their wives almost 20 years earlier.\nHowever, could Ivanka Trump - described as her father's \"proxy wife\" by Vanity Fair during the election campaign - take up some of the responsibility from her step-mother?\nThere is more recent precedent, too. Chelsea performed some of her mother's duties during the final days of her father's presidency, while Mrs Clinton concentrated on her own political career.\nThe White House can be whatever the family makes it.\nChelsea was known to do her homework in the Oval Office from time to time, while she also hosted sleepovers for friends - which could mean they found themselves sitting with the President the next morning, as Bill Clinton always tried to have breakfast with his daughter.\nBoth Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama fit their duties as First Lady around their children, and both families asked for the press to respect their daughters' privacy - requests which were, on the whole, respected.\nThe Obamas are also strict about putting time aside for the girls: family dinner takes place every night at 18:30. Mr Obama has said only a national emergency will stop him joining his family.\n\"The surprising truth is that being in the White House has made our family life more 'normal' than it's ever been,\" the President said in an interview with US magazine More earlier this year.\nIt is a response echoed by Chelsea about her own years.\nShe told the Huffington Post: \"I was always deeply aware that I was living in history. But then I would have dinner with my parents at the kitchen table every night. There was so much about my life that also was normal.\"",

So, unlike the towering Maya pyramids of Central America, they were likely not visible above the forest canopy, and this raises questions about their purpose,\" he explained.\nIt had been assumed prior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 16th Century, the Amazonian forests had been pristine ecosystems, free from human influence.\nBut the new research indicates a wide variety of plant species spread over 6,000 years, which could only have been artificially brought together by humans.\nIt suggested instead of burning large tracts of forest - either for geoglyph construction or agricultural practices - people transformed their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees such as palms.\nThe team have likened it to a form of \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products.\nThey said there is \"tantalizing evidence\" to suggest the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests may retain a strong legacy of these ancient \"agroforestry\" practices to this day.",

        "document": "After weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.\nAlthough many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.\nExtend, yes, but for just one more year.\nSuperficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.\nDid Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?\nWas he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?\nOr was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?\nThe third, it appears, was the clincher.\nWhen Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to \"taking an egg out of omelette\"), was a remote one.\nBut that all changed on 23 June.\nBeyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.\nIf he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.\nShould he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?\nThat might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.\nAnd the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he \"wanted to serve\" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.\nBut, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a \"third way\" - the short extension.\nThe reasons were personal and unique.\nIn 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.\nLike everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.\nFor his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.\nHe hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.\n\"To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,\" he said about whether he would extend his stay.\n\"No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.\n\"Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.\"\nThose around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of \"tension\" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.\nNeither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.\nProfessionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.\nBut, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.\nBy then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.",

The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June\n10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference\nAnd former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary.\nWhen last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately \u00a3225,000.\nThey still owe over \u00a370,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\nAn offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for \u00a31 and take over the running at Edgar Street.\nBut, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option.\nKeyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover.\nThe downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates.\nThe average attendance for the 2013-14 season at Edgar Street was 1,758, little over half the average gate they attracted of 3,270 in League Two just five years ago.",

        "document": "Jamie Vardy's crisp finish from a lightning break gave Leicester the lead on 18 minutes - but he was then sent off after getting a second yellow card for diving when he tangled with Angelo Ogbonna early in the second half.\nReferee Jonathan Moss made himself even more unpopular when he awarded West Ham a penalty with six minutes left. There had been pushing and pulling in both penalty areas but he decided to punish Wes Morgan for pulling back Winston Reid at a corner.\nAnalysis: MOTD2 pundits on referee's 'mind-boggling inconsistencies'\nSubstitute Andy Carroll slotted home to end Leicester's run of 574 minutes without conceding a league goal and Aaron Cresswell looked to have opened the door to the Foxes' title rivals Spurs with a stunning left-footed finish two minutes later.\nAs the game went into injury time, Moss produced another controversial decision when he pointed to the spot once more after Carroll made the merest contact with Jeff Schlupp.\nWest Ham clearly felt Moss had evened things up after earlier decisions in their favour, but Ulloa was not concerned as he took the chance to secure what might yet be a vital point - although Leicester will be without Vardy for next weekend's home game with Swansea.\nRelive the action from the King Power Stadium\nLeicester's fans celebrated at the end before turning their anger on referee Moss - although it was his very questionable decision that allowed them to earn that point at the end.\nPsychologically, this point could be vital because a loss might just have produced a few doubts and given Spurs just a little more wiggle room going into their game at Stoke on Monday.\nIt means Leicester's last Premier League defeat is still that last-minute loss at Arsenal on Valentine's Day and their spirits will be lifted by the manner in which they earned a point when it seemed certain they would end up empty-handed.\nReferee Moss was surrounded by players of both sides and escorted from the field by stewards to jeering from the home fans at the final whistle.\nMoss's eventful second half began after 56 minutes when he penalised Vardy for simulation as he tumbled theatrically under a challenge from Ogbonna. Having already given Vardy a yellow card, he felt obliged to give a second.\nVardy made the most of the contact and ran the risk of punishment. And he has been accused of doing this before this season. Opinion was split but plenty felt Moss was right.\nFor West Ham's penalty, there was undoubtedly pulling and pushing between Morgan and Winston Reid - so again Moss had justification.\nThe difficulty, the inconsistency, is that similar behaviour had been going on in both penalty areas all afternoon without punishment - so why did Moss decide this was the time to penalise it?\nToo often, these decisions seem arbitrary, as was demonstrated when Ogbonna dragged Huth to the floor even more unceremoniously a few minutes later and no foul was given.\nFinally, in injury time and with an atmosphere of chaos engulfing the game, Moss pointed to the spot for the slightest touch from Carroll on Schlupp. It was incredibly harsh and the Hammers clearly felt Moss had punished them to make up for earlier decisions given against Leicester.\nIt is a tough job - as the abuse directed the referee's way at the end proved.\nNot as much as there might have been had Ulloa not scored at the end, but they can apply pressure and move to within five points of Leicester if they win at Stoke.\nLeicester at least have the point in the bag but Mauricio Pochettino and his players will just feel the door is ajar, even if they know time and games are running out.\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"It was a very tough match. We were lucky at the beginning when they touched both posts. After that we scored a great goal and we had an opportunity to finish the match at the beginning of the second half.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"After then sending off it changed our match.\n\"I never spoke about the decision of the referee. Two yellow cards, that's it.\n\"Our performance 11 v 11 and 10 v 11 was fantastic.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"It was a good game of football. We showed determination, character and quality. We turned the game around. We were dangerous, and after sending off we totally dominated the game.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"After our second goal I thought we had done enough to win the game, maybe we could have coped with added time better in terms of keeping the ball but they took the risk.\n\"It was extremely hard for referee, but I mean that was no penalty at all.\"\nLeicester - minus the suspended Vardy - are at home to Swansea next Sunday.

It was like living in a different world, not like living on earth.\nThey used a blade to cut the letters RUF into my chest, so if I was thinking about escaping I knew that I could be killed if I got caught by militia who supported the government.\nThe rebels also threatened to cut off my legs or arms if I tried to flee, and I saw this happen to other people.\nSometimes they would even take out the heart from someone's chest and cook it up with onions and ask people to eat it.\nIt seems like a nightmare now.\nI remember when we used to look for food and demanded that people hand it over.\nIf they said: \"We don't have food\", we told them they were lying, and then we beat them even if they could have been telling the truth.\nSometimes we were forced to kill, which we did under the influence of drugs: Marijuana was very easy to take - we used it like people drink coffee - and cocaine was also available.\nI was given the impression that if you took these drugs then you would be brave and if you were brave you would have the opportunity in the jungle to climb up the ranks.\nLuckily I did manage to escape from the jungle without being killed and I went to the capital, Freetown, but was unable to find my relatives.\nI lived alone, but teamed up with some guys doing things like pick-pocketing and I was caught.\nFortunately [while in jail] I met a preacher called Richard Cole, who was the founder of a project called Lifeline Nehemiah which aimed to give hope, and a home, to people like me who felt they had lost hope.\nHe encouraged me saying: \"You used to cause atrocities, but you can be used to contribute to rebuild the nation.\"\nAt the home he encouraged me to continue with my schooling, he also told me that guys like me would be leaders of the nation and help to rebuild it.\nRichard taught me that it was God who was taking me through all these troubling times, and I also learnt that it was important to give back what was invested in me.\nHe passed away in 2006 but we had that vision and continue with it.\nWhen the Ebola crisis came to Sierra Leone in 2014 we considered it to be a common enemy.\nWe were not medical practitioners but we had the passion to change things and we decided to develop our clinic to bring in suspected Ebola cases.\nThrough this so many lives were saved.\nThere were three key activities.\nWe started with education as people found it difficult to accept that Ebola was real. So we started visiting communities and explaining that it was real and it was a death sentence.\nWe educated more than 10,000 people, and explained the message in their languages - Temne, Krio and Limba.\nSecondly we started supporting people by giving them food and other items. This became a massive operation - visiting 11,000 people - and started giving fresh food in urban and rural areas.\nThirdly we were able to team up with other agencies and put up an Ebola treatment unit that saved so many lives.\nPeople were frightened.\nSometimes when we visited people refused to accept us but as we kept coming back we became familiar to them.\nIt was scary and some people said it was witchcraft, but we persuaded them that there were principles to observe to protect themselves.\nOne of the worst incidents I witnessed was when I saw a pregnant woman with suspected Ebola lying in front of us.\nThere were three others in the house who were also suspected cases and no-one could come to their house because it was too dangerous.\nWhen I saw that woman lying there I felt very bad, I came out and talked with other volunteers and after that we started to set up an Ebola treatment clinic.\nWe didn't have any funds but we had a lot of help from local chiefs and the community, and that was how it started.\nNow I see my life as a changed person.\nI regret all that I did, but I am confident now that the future is great.\nWe are investing in young people; I believe young people have a role in changing the world, not only Sierra Leone but the world.\nIf we invest in them then we are building the future.\n11,314\nDeaths - probable, confirmed and suspected\n(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)\n4,808 Liberia\n3,955 Sierra Leone\n2,536 Guinea\n8 Nigeria",

        "document": "Compared with other European countries, many apprenticeships are low quality and too short, the Sutton Trust warns.\nIt says thousands of apprenticeships should be created to boost the economy and improve youngsters' job prospects.\nThe Department for Education says apprenticeships are being reformed to \"drive up standards\".\nThe Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved.\nThe study, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the Sutton Trust, says fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three - which is equivalent to A-level.\nThe report cites figures that suggest  apprenticeships are offered by just one in five (20%) of employers in England, compared with over half (51%) in Germany, which, the report says, is considered to have one of the best vocational education systems.\nOnly 61,000 new apprenticeship starts were for young people, whereas in Germany, 570,000 new apprenticeships are for youngsters and 90% of these are equivalent to A-levels.\nThe report also notes that England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications, while Germany has 330.\nThe report warns that since 2010, more than half (58%) of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters have been aimed at those over the age of 25, many of whom are already in work.\nAnd it warns 11 young people are competing for each apprenticeship.\nIn his foreword to the report, Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said the report had found that, with some exceptions, the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were \"poor\".\nThe attitude in England, with some exceptions, was very different to that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, he said.\n\"Instead of a clear system of respected vocational routes, we suffer from a complicated patchwork where too many young people are offered qualifications of little worth in a system that confuses employers and is not valued as it should be by society,\" he said.\nHe said the \"cruel deception\" about an expansion in apprenticeships, when many were below level three and the majority went to older workers, had to stop.\nThe report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded, with up to 300,000 new starts each year. The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels.\nNo more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says.\nSir Peter said: \"Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees.\n\"Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice.\n\"England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs.\"\nTeresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: \"Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do.\n\"The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved.\n\"The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved.\"\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers.\n\"Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers. We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year, include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job.\n\"We have consulted on wider reforms to drive up standards in apprenticeships further, and will publish plans later this month.\"",

Only senior managers are exempted.\nThe aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them.\nAgency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in.\nNHS Improvement said the progress being made was \"promising\", but it still leaves the NHS short.\nThe latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be.\nAnd while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen.\nThe figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \"bank\" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime.\nNHS Improvement said it would start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year.\nInformation on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work.\nIt found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted \u00a3130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be \u00a376, while another was quoted \u00a370 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be \u00a335.\nNHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: \"The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff.

        "document": "Biologists studied a group of Sydney octopuses off Australia's east coast and observed a range of behaviour that may indicate complex social signalling.\nOctopuses that stand tall, turn dark and spread their web in a \"Nosferatu pose\" are likely showing aggression.\nConversely, octopuses may display a pale colour after losing a fight or when trying to avoid conflict.\nIt was previously believed that octopuses were largely solitary creatures. Changes to body colour and other behaviour were interpreted as tactics to avoid predators.\nBut Prof Peter Godfrey-Smith said the unique study, based on 53 hours of footage and published on Friday in the journal Current Biology, provided a novel perspective on octopus behaviour.\n\"[An aggressive] octopus will turn very dark, stand in a way that accentuates its size and it will often seek to stand on a higher spot,\" Prof Godfrey-Smith, who co-authored the report, said.\n\"Clearly the unusual stance is not a physiological response. It makes it look as big as it can possibly be, with its arms spread out below and the mantle, the back part of the animal, raised over the head.\n\"The dark colour is produced in concert with those size-accentuating behaviours. There's no particular physiological reason why darkness should be associated with aggression, but it does give the impression of a larger object.\"\nThe researchers, based in Australia and the US, dubbed the stance the \"Nosferatu pose\", referring to the classic 1920s horror film, because the spread of the octopus's web was reminiscent of a vampire's cape.\nOctopuses frequently turned pale while retreating from aggressors and also produced high-contrast patterns known as deimatic displays.\nThe contrasting patterns were most frequently observed when octopuses were attempting to return to their den after they had been forced out, or in the presence of an aggressive individual.\n\"Suppose there's a large, aggressive guy there and you want to get back into our den, if you approach with a pale colour it could be interpreted as a non-confrontational behaviour,\" Prof Godfrey-Smith said.\nThe study also found that two octopuses displaying dark colours were likely to fight if in close proximity, while a darker-coloured octopus was likely to stand its ground against a lighter-coloured octopus.\nAnother cephalopod, the cuttlefish, shows a similar set of features, with aggressive males darkening their faces and paler males withdrawing from fights.\nThe unusually high number of octopuses living together in the colony off Jervis Bay, south of Sydney, allowed a more in-depth observation of interactions than had previously been possible.\nProf Godfrey-Smith's co-author David Scheel and his students combed through 53 hours of footage and observed 186 interactions between the octopuses.\nThis included the Nosferatu pose, along with reaching, grappling and mating.\nWatching these long videos was \"much more exhausting than I expected\", Prof Godfrey Smith said.\n\"Identifying an individual from minute to minute is very difficult, because they change colour and shape.\n\"If the octopus wanders out of the frame, there's not much you can do.\"",

We've learnt not to question [the government's] ambition too much because they've quite often exceeded what we thought was possible,\" he said.\nBut Ethiopia, like tiny nearby Rwanda, poses some difficult questions for democratic countries with good intentions.\nBoth nations have achieved remarkable economic growth in the context of an often highly repressive form of governance.\nCritics accuse donors of quietly ignoring human rights abuses, or even of indirectly sustaining them.\nMr Conway acknowledged there were a lot of \"hard arguments\" with Ethiopia's government, and \"there are policies we don't support, and won't\".\nBut he praised a bilateral partnership that \"is really quite effective\".\nThe clear hope, on both sides, is that with the right, sustainable, projects Ethiopia can wean itself off foreign aid within the foreseeable future.\nNear the small hillside village of Bahari Hatsra just outside Korem, we found 40-year-old Admassie Mekonen walking home with a simple wooden plough on his shoulder, after a day's work on the small field he rents.\nFor the past four years he, his wife and 10-year-old daughter have benefited from a partly British-funded programme that pays Mr Admassie a monthly wage of about \u00c2\u00a320 ($31) during the six-month \"food gap\" season before harvest, when the family has exhausted its supplies.\nIn return, he works on a variety of public projects, chosen by the community - terracing the hillsides, for example, to prevent soil erosion.\nThe programme is a part of a recent shift away from giving foreign aid money to support individual governments, and instead to put it directly in the hands of the poor.\n\"It's hundreds of thousands of man-hours every year... it's restored the landscape,\" said Mr Conway.\nBut the challenges ahead remain significant.\nEthiopia's population is heading towards 100 million, with a quarter still living in extreme poverty.\nSitting down in front of his simple wood and mud home, Mr Admassie said the cash payments had, at times, saved his family from starvation. But he questioned whether he would ever be able to manage without them.\n\"I don't own any land. I rent my fields. I have to give half the crop to the owner as payment.\n\"I can work hard now, but I worry about what will happen when I get older. I will have to go to the city to find work,\" he said.",

        "document": "Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful, the government had to show its willingness to offer \"concrete solutions\".\n\"We want someone who can speak for the royal family,\" he said.\nCrown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands.\nHardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies.\nThey fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust.\nHowever, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue.\n\"We welcome it, we are ready for it,\" he said. \"We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary.\"\nThe al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties.\n\"A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people\".\nBut he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority.\nSheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy.\n\"We had an agreement with the crown prince,\" he said. \"The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue.\"\nAsked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was \"hopeful\" that he would \"do more than his predecessor\", Hillary Clinton.\n\"US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more.\"\nOn the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt.\n\"If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically.\n\"It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations.\n\"So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy.\"\nSheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for \"peaceful demonstrations\", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain.\n\"It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government.\"\nHe also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government.\n\"These people have a lot of followers in the street.  If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail.\"",

If anything, they've been better than they were last season. With Rangers in the league, with a stronger Hearts team, they've still been the second-top team in Scotland and I think Derek and his players deserve enormous credit for that.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Even if Rangers were to win (on Sunday), I don't think they will finish second. Aberdeen have been so consistent, especially at home, so I fully expect Rangers to lose.\"\nThe Dons have made Pittodrie a fortress this season, embarking on a 10-game winning streak on their home patch.\nThey may have been eased aside by all-conquering Celtic in November's League Cup final, but have the chance to reach another national showpiece when they face Hibernian in the Scottish Cup last four on 22 April.\n\"Derek can't win the league, not against this Celtic side,\" Thompson added. \"Success can be measured in other ways. To reach both cup finals would be success in itself, to finish second, to get European football again, to break records - I'm not sure what else he can do.\n\"The consistency they've shown in the last two seasons has been phenomenal. I just think there aren't enough plaudits out there for Derek McInnes and the work he's done.\"\nMeanwhile, former Rangers player Thompson admits he has been baffled by the actions of new Ibrox boss, Pedro Caixinha.\nThe Portuguese took the unusual step of revealing his team line-up a day before Wednesday's goalless draw with Kilmarnock, and two days ahead of their showdown with the Dons predicted the starting XI McInnes would select.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"For me, it's nonsensical to give the opposition your team,\" Thompson said. \"It gives them extra time to prepare, and insight into how they're going to go about beating your side.\n\"I've never worked under a manager who would consider giving away his team lines, let alone a day before like he did. I found that puzzling.\n\"Possibly even more puzzling was to name the Aberdeen team. I think he's trying to show he's done his homework, but you can pretty much name the Aberdeen team because it doesn't change too often.\n\"If I was Derek McInnes, what would I think of that? Is it mind games? It's not very good mind games, if you ask me.\"\nThompson, who made over 60 appearances for Rangers, says Caixinha's carefree style sits in stark contrast with the rigidity and structure of his predecessor, Mark Warburton.\nThe 46-year-old led the Gers to a thumping win over Hamilton Academical in his first game in charge, but has since dropped points with successive draws against Motherwell and Kilmarnock.\n\"It's far too early to be making judgements,\" Thompson asserted. \"None of these players are Caixinha's players. I suspect in the summer you'll see a substantial recruitment drive.\n\"One thing that struck me is he's not afraid to do something radical. I know he had injury problems, but he took off three of his back-four, completely changed his shape against Motherwell. That raised a few eyebrows, although they got back into the game.\n\"Caixinha looks like he's going to start taking risks. With that, you have to make sure you're getting results as well. It won't happen this season, but if he continues to take risks like he does and he isn't getting results next season, it won't be long before he receives criticism.\"",

        "document": "Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise \u00a34.5bn a year.\nThat would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said.\nLabour said new homes were urgently needed but \"driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods\" was not the answer.\nIn its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart.\nNeil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be \"less of it\".\n\"The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town.\n\"People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,\" he said.\nHe also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"This is something that councils can choose to do already.\n\"Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years.\n\"They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently.\n\"If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at.\"\nBut Labour said the coalition's \"failed\" polices were \"making the housing crisis worse not better\".\nShadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: \"Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.\"\nHe said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and \"put unemployed builders back to work\" and boost the construction industry.\n'Lucky family'\nExpensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says.\nThis equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to \u00a3159bn if sold.\nIt says London alone has more than \u00a370bn of expensive social housing.\nAbout 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said.\nThis meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising \u00a35.5bn a year. The figure would stand at \u00a34.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said.\nMr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to.\n\"Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads.\n\"That seems fairer to me,\" he added.\nThe think tank also said the move would be \"extremely popular\" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority.\n'Dramatic erosion'\nCritics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos.\nThe National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be \"cleansed\" of \"hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices\".\nLabour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor.\nMs Buck also argued that the Labour government's \u00a38bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power.\nHousing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced \"radical reforms\" to \"get Britain building\" and to reduce social housing waiting lists.\nThey included investing \u00a319.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme \"set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes\".\nCouncils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure \"social housing goes to those in greatest need\", he added.",

        "document": "It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime.\nLiving in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls.\nThe government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live.\nThe study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers.\nThey found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18.\nPoorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts.\nAnd household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending.\nThis was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said.\nThey found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime.\nThe study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts.\nGirls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said.\nThis was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account.\nThe findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal.\nThe study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles.\nIt has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government.\nReport author Prof Lesley McAra said: \"Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty.\n\"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\"\nScottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime.\nA study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities.\nHalf of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed.\nA third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment.\nLead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades.\n\"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\"\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets.\n\"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a \u00c2\u00a3296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"",

It is the most serious confrontation between the two nations for several years.\nIn Monday's telephone call, Mr Kerry \"said China's introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was provocative\", US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.\n\"He urged both sides to de-escalate tensions, ensure safe conduct by their vessels at sea, and resolve the dispute through peaceful means in accordance with international law.\"\nSeparately, in comments made at a meeting with the Singaporean foreign minister, Mr Kerry called the Chinese move an \"aggressive act\".\nMr Wang, meanwhile, urged Mr Kerry to be objective on the issue, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said.\nTensions between Beijing and Manila are also running high, after the Philippines arrested and then charged nine Chinese fishermen with poaching at a disputed shoal.\nThe Philippines is in the process of taking China to a UN court over its territorial claims.\nIt has also recently signed a new security deal with the US which would allow an expanded US troop presence, in a move seen as linked to Manila's deteriorating ties with Beijing.\nOn Tuesday, Chinese state media slammed the Philippines, saying that if it continued to challenge China it would pay \"an unaffordable price\".",

        "document": "On everything from music to microwaves, and taxis to train tickets.\nConsumers save money by doing their transactions on a computer or mobile phone.\nBut not when it comes to banking.\nCustomers of UK banks who use the internet pay just as much for overdrafts and fees as everyone else.\nThese low-maintenance customers rarely need to call their bank, let alone visit the local branch. From the bank's point of view, they are cheap to look after.\nYet they get no price reductions.\nOn the face of it, digital customers are getting a raw deal.\nLloyds - the UK's biggest retail banking group - boasts that is has 10 million customers who access its services via the internet.\nIn effect, those 10 million are paying for the other 12 million customers who still want a premium and personalised service; namely the ability to go in to a centrally-heated, business-rate paying, well-decorated and well-staffed High Street branch, to speak to a human being.\n\"If I'm just using online, and never go into a branch, or never ring a call-centre, I would expect to get a better price, because otherwise I am subsidising those people who go into a branch,\" says Kevin Mountford, head of banking at MoneySupermarket.\nNo bank will say how much its branch network really costs them. But Lloyds has no fewer than 1,300 such branches in England and Wales alone. And Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) spent \u00a3400m last year on refurbishments.\nEither way, transactions on the internet cost banks a tiny fraction of those in-branch, or compared to the cost of processing a cheque.\n\"As a customer, if I am seeing that my behaviour brings down the operational cost, what's in it for me?\" says Mr Mountford.\n\"I would expect something back. But unfortunately it doesn't happen.\"\nNone of the big High Street banks offer their customers separate internet banking directly. However HSBC and The Co-operative Bank do so under separate brands.\nOne of them is Smile, the first full internet bank to be set up, in 1999, and owned by the Co-op.\nSmile customers borrowing \u00a3500 for a month benefit significantly. The cost is just \u00a37.34, as opposed to \u00a317.40 with the Co-op.\nThe other is First Direct, which - as a telephone and internet bank only - has much lower running costs than its parent brand, HSBC.\nYet First Direct charges \u00a383.05 to fund a \u00a3500 overdraft for a month, only marginally cheaper than HSBC's \u00a387.52.\nMark Mullen, the former chief executive of First Direct - and now boss of Atom Bank - is not impressed.\n\"I think it is astonishing that you can have banks with very different cost bases, very different sizes of banks, and very different histories of technology, yet somehow miraculously they price just about the same.\"\nOthers might wonder why, if Smile charges \u00a37.34 for an overdraft, and HSBC charges \u00a387.52 for exactly the same thing, more customers aren't switching; or why the self-evident benefits of internet banking aren't available more widely.\nThe banks concerned argue that customers are unlikely to be charged the amounts listed above, as they would be advised to take out a personal loan instead of the more expensive overdraft option.\nIn any case, the mainstream banks believe consumers should not be getting lower prices for banking online.\nThey are acutely aware that differential pricing would make life more expensive for older and vulnerable customers, who rely on a branch network, and often still use cheques.\nJames Daley, the managing director of Fairer Finance, and a former campaigner with Which? believes that banks have a social responsibility to provide an equal service for everybody.\n\"You start telling pensioners that they're going to have to pay twice as much for their banking services because they aren't comfortable with the internet - I don't think that would be the right solution.\n\"I wouldn't want to advocate a world where people who bank predominantly online end up with significantly better deals than those customers who have to use branches.\"\nSo are online customers going to have to continue tolerating paying over the odds for banking?\nThe answer to that could depend on the launch of Atom, the UK's first truly internet-only bank, sometime before Easter.\nBuilt from scratch, with just 150 staff at its Durham headquarters, Atom will only offer access via the internet or an app. No branches, no call centres.\nAs a result of its low cost base, it is promising cheaper prices.\n\"We would expect to be more competitive when it comes to some - not all - of our charges, and some of our costs,\" says Mark Mullen.\nFor example, customers will not be forced to pay both an interest charge and a fee for an overdraft.\nAnd there will be no distinction between an authorised and an unauthorised overdraft. \"That's just nonsense\", says Mr Mullen.\nBut even if Atom does offer its users a significantly better deal, the rest of the industry may not feel obliged to follow suit. In this market, competition does not work as it should.\nSo without a significant shift in banks' attitudes, digital customers may continue to argue they're not getting a good deal.\nBut they may just have to lump it.\nMonday: Do other countries offer consumers better banking than the UK?",

The other half is paid on 31 January.\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) warned that anyone who failed to renew their tax credits could be in danger of having payments stopped, or find themselves paying more than they needed to.\n\"It is great that millions of people have renewed their tax credits or reported changes so far, but anyone who has not done so yet should take action now - it only takes a few minutes to renew online,\" said Nick Lodge, of HMRC.\nRenewals can now also be completed via smartphone apps. The tax credit helpline - 0345 3003900 - is open until 20:00 BST on Saturday and Sunday.\nTo renew, they will need their renewal pack, their National Insurance number, their and their partners total income for the tax year to April 2016, the 15-digit number on their renewal pack, and details of any changes to their circumstances, such as working hours and children.\nClaimants who received notices in a brown A5 envelope will see their tax credits renewed automatically and are only required to contact HMRC if they need to make any corrections or notify HMRC of any changes to household circumstances.\nThose whose notices came in a white A4 envelope must renew, even if their circumstances have not changed.\nThe tax payment deadline affects everyone in the self-assessment system unless:\nThere are various ways of paying but those leaving it to the weekend are likely to be limited to paying via online or telephone banking, or via the HMRC website using a debit or credit card.\nInterest is charged if the payment deadline is missed. After 28 days without payment, following the deadline, a surcharge is 5% of any unpaid tax is levied. This surcharge is repeated after six months.\n\"This is a massive amount given the era of near zero interest rates,\" said Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at ACCA accountancy body.\nAn HMRC spokesman pointed out that there was some wriggle room for those who contact HMRC if they are struggling to pay the tax owed.\n\"If a taxpayer can't pay and calls us before the due date and we agree a time to pay arrangement, they will not incur a surcharge,\" he said.\n\"Our reasoning being the taxpayer is making an effort and it would not be fair to hit them with a surcharge, where a time to pay arrangement is in place.\"\nHMRC has been criticised by MPs and the National Audit Office for waiting times for those trying to call at key times, but the tax authority said the service had now improved.",
